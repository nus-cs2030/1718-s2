It explores two modern programming paradigms, object-oriented programming and functional programming.  Through a series of integrated assignments, students will learn to develop medium-scale software programs in the order of thousands of lines of code and tens of classes using object-oriented design principles and advanced programming constructs available in the two paradigms.  Topics include objects and classes, composition, association, inheritance, interface, polymorphism, abstract classes, dynamic binding, lambda expression, effect-free programming, first class functions, closures, continuations, monad, etc.  \n\n\nWho/When/Where\n\n\n\n\nLecture:\n 10am - 12noon, every Monday\n\n\nVenue:\n LT19\n\n\nInstructor:\n \nOoi Wei Tsang\n (\nooiwt@comp.nus.edu.sg\n)\n\n\nTeaching Assistant:\n \n\n\nLan Ziquan (\nziquan@comp.nus.edu.sg\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUG Tutors:\n\n\nBernard Teo Zhi Yi\n\n\nChang Ho Huan\n\n\nChung Zhi Li, Denzel\n\n\nEvan Tay\n\n\nHo Boon Wee Addison\n\n\nJeremy Lim Yu Xuan\n\n\nJoshi Atharv Abhay\n\n\nLim Heng Guang\n\n\nLin Si Jie\n\n\nOng Yan Zhi\n\n\nQiu Siyu\n\n\nTan Thong Cai, Nelvin\n\n\nTay Hui Chun\n\n\nTeh Zi Cong Nicholas\n\n\nThangavel Sharan\n\n\nTriston Pang Erh Syen\n\n\nWinson Heng Yong Seng\n\n\nYuen Jun Rong\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLab:\n Every Tuesday (Week 3 - Week 13)\n\n\nMidterm Test:\n March 5, 2018, Monday, 10am\n\n\nFinal Assessment:\n May 3, 2018, Thursday\n\n\n\n\nWorkload\n\n\nBesides the 4-hour contact time for lecture and lab, students are expected to spend about 6 hours on average weekly on homework and on preparing the class.\n\n\nHistory\n\n\nCS2030 is a new module, required for all students in Bachelor of Computing (Computer Science) and Second Major in Computer Science students, cohort 17/18 onwards.  In 2017, the Department of Computer Science reorganized the two module series on data structures and algorithms (CS1020, CS2010) into (CS2030, CS2040).  CS2040 focuses on data structures and algorithms, while the advanced programming methodologies from CS1020 are moved into CS2030.  CS2030 will also covers some basics OO design that previously were covered in CS2103, and introduces students to functional programming, concurrent programming, event-based programming, and other paradigms that are increasingly important.\n\n\nLearning Outcomes\n\n\nAfter completing the module, students should:\n\n\n\n\nbe confident in reading and developing medium-scale programs (up to 10K lines of code)\n\n\nbe familiarize enough with common OO concepts to understand software code written in common OO language and understand documentation of software libraries in OO\n\n\nbe able to apply OO concepts to design and implement medium to large scale  programs, including\n\n\ndesign and implement a class\n\n\ndecompose a problem solution into classes and define members and methods for each class\n\n\nuse polymorphism effectively\n\n\nuse inheritance to design simple class hierarchies that allow code reuse\n\n\ntrace the control flow of a programs that use dynamic dispatch\n\n\nuse encapsulation mechanisms such as interfaces, private methods/members\n\n\n\n\n\n\nbe familiarize enough with common functional programming concepts and constructs, including lambda expression, effect-free programming, first class functions, infinite streams.\n\n\nbe able to apply functional programming concepts to design and implement , including:\n\n\nImplement basic algorithms in functions that are effect free.\n\n\nImplement useful functions that take/return another function\n\n\nWrite correct and effective code using lambda expressions and/or infinite streams\n\n\n\n\n\n\nbe able to compare and contrast imperative programming, OO programming, and function programming paradigms, and select the most natural paradigms for each situation\n\n\nbe aware of how the OOP and FP concepts are implemented in different ways in different programming languages\n\n\nbe confident enough to learn new programming languages that uses OOP and FP paradigm\n\n\nattain proficiency in Java 8 (and above)\n\n\nbe equipped with solid programming foundations for further studies in computer science\n\n\n\n\nTextbook\n\n\nThere is no textbook for this class.\n\n\nThere are many good books and online articles written about the topics covered in the module.

Prefix your email subject with \n[CS2030]\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease use \nPiazza\n for other matters related to the module.  If you email us privately and we feel that your questions/answers are useful to the rest of the class, we will publish it on Piazza, with anonymization when appropriate.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLab Sessions\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe do take attendance during the lab sessions, but it does not affect your grades if you do not attend the lab sessions as long as you still need to submit the graded lab exercises.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou should stick to your allocated time slot for labs.  If there is a strong reason for your to attend another lab session, please inform your lab instructors.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLate Submissions\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAll graded exercise must be submitted on time.  If you need an extension, please ask for one and provide a justification for approval.  Only academic reasons can be considered (e.g., representing NUS for a sports event is OK, going for vacation is not)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor late submission, there is a 1% penalty (of the assessment grade) for every 5-minute after the deadline, capped at 80%.  For example, if a homework is deserved 40 marks, and it is submitted 100 minutes after the deadline, the student will get 32 marks instead (20% penalty).  If it is submitted 10 hours after the deadline, the student will get 8 marks (as it has hit the cap of 80% penalty).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDiscussions and Plagiarism\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe encourage discussions among students for lab assignments, but each student should be responsible for writing his/her own code and should give credits to others when appropriate.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nNUS and School of Computing have a high standard on academic honesty and take any violation seriously.  In the context of computing modules, source code plagiarism -- copying code from another source and attributing it as one's own code -- is a series violation.   Please read the page \nPreventing Plagiarism\n from the school's website to familiarize yourself with the policy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI adopt a \"no mercy\" policy when it comes to disciplinary action on plagiarism.  Both parties, the student who copied, and the student who allowed others to copy, will be penalized equally.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLecture Video\n\n\n\n\n\n\nScreencast will be recorded and posted online 2-3 days after the lecture. \nThis will be done on a 'best effort' basis and screencast will not be guaranteed to be available.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nPosting of screencast is meant to help students who attended the lecture to recap the content, or to help those who are not able to attend the lecture due to unexpected circumstances.  It does not mean that you should skip lecture.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nModel Solutions and Slides\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSlides will be posted \nafter\n the class.  Note that slides are used as a \nvisual aid\n to assist me during lecture.  It is not meant as summary of lectures nor a replacement of lecture notes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn a module like CS2030, there is often not a single correct answer.  Hence, there is no model solution for this module.  Sample solutions may be posted (both good and bad ones) for discussion.  I strongly encourage students to discuss your solution with me, instead of just comparing your solution with the sample solution.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGrading\n\n\n\n\nStudents will received the grades they deserved irrespective of how the other students in the class performed (i.e., no bell curve)\n\n\n\n\nOpen Book Assessment\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAll assessment, including graded labs, midterm test, and final assessment, are open book assessment -- you can bring in your notes or other \nanalog\n reference materials.  Java documentation will be made available during labs.  Relevant Java APIs will be provided during midterm tests and final assessments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere is \nnothing to memorize\n for this class.",

You should see four java files (\nPoint.java\n, \nCircle.java\n, \nMaxDiscCover.java\n, and \nLabZero.java\n), and a few data files (\nTESTDATA1.txt\n, \nTESTDATA2.txt\n, ..., \nTESTDATA5.txt\n)\n\n\nRead through the files above.  Although we have seen \nCircle\n and \nPoint\n as examples in class, these classes are slightly different.\n\n\n1. Augment the class Point\n\n\nAugment the class \nPoint\n with the following public methods and constructors.\nYou may find the static methods provided by \njava.lang.Math\n useful.\n\n\n1.1. Static Method to construct mid point\n\n\n1\npublic\n \nstatic\n \nPoint\n \nmidPoint\n(\nPoint\n \np\n,\n \nPoint\n \nq\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGiven two points \np\n and \nq\n, create and return the midpoint of \np\n and \nq\n.\n\n\n1.2 Distance between points\n\n\n1\npublic\n \ndouble\n \ndistanceTo\n(\nPoint\n \nq\n)\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou should have written something like this from your Exercise 1.  This method returns the Euclidean distance of \nthis\n point to the point \nq\n.\n\n\n1.3 Angle between points\n\n\n1\npublic\n \ndouble\n \nangleTo\n(\nPoint\n \nq\n)\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis method returns the angle between the current point and point \nq\n.  In the figure below, it returns the angle \n\\(\\theta\\)\n.  You can compute this using the \natan2()\n function. For instance, \n\n1\n2\nPoint\n \np\n \n=\n \nnew\n \nPoint\n(\n0\n,\n \n0\n);\n\n\np\n.\nangleTo\n(\nnew\n \nPoint\n(\n1\n,\n \n1\n));\n\n\n\n\n\nshould return\n\n1\n0.7853981633974483\n\n\n\n\nwhich is \n\\(\\pi/4\\)\n.\n\n\n1\np.angleTo(new Point(1, 0));\n\n\n\n\n\n\nshould return \n\n\n1\n0.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\natan2()\n takes in two \ndouble\n as arguments for coordinate \nx\n and \ny\n. It returns \ntheta\n, the angle in radian, counted in \nanti-clockwise direction with respect to origin. One mathematical trick here is if you subtract the coordinates \nof \nPoint p\n from \nPoint q\n, you basically reduce \nPoint p\n to be an origin to \nPoint q\n. \nFor more detail, please refer to the Java API for \natan2\n for more details.\n\n\n\n\n1.4. Move a point\n\n\n1\npublic\n \nvoid\n \nmove\n(\ndouble\n \ntheta\n,\n \ndouble\n \nd\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMove the point by a given distance at direction theta (in radian).  See Figure:\n\n\n\n\nThe new point should have the coordinate (\n\\(x + d\\cos\\theta, y + d\\sin\\theta\\)\n).  Note in this method, you are given the angle (theta) and want to find length. Hence you need to use cosine and sine.\n\n\nAfter\n\n1\np.move(p.angleTo(q), p.distanceTo(q));\n\n\n\n\n\np\n should coincide with \nq\n.\n\n\n\n\nMutable vs. Immutable\n\n\nThe method \nmove\n is called a \nmutable\n method, since it modifies (mutates) the object that it is called on.  Later in CS2030, you will be introduced to the concept of \nimmutable\n methods.\n\n\n\n\n2. Augment the class Circle\n\n\nAugment the class \nCircle\n with the following methods and constructors:\n\n\n2.1 Constructor\n\n\n1\npublic\n \nCircle\n(\nPoint\n \np\n,\n \nPoint\n \nq\n,\n \ndouble\n \nradius\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe constructor above takes in two points \np\n and \nq\n, and returns a circle  that passes through both \np\n and \nq\n, with radius \nradius\n.  \n\n\nThere are two such possible circles (see figures below) if distance between \np\n and \nq\n is no greater than 2x\nradius\n1\n.  Imagine if you walk from \np\n to \nq\n, one of the circle will have the center on your left, the other will have the center on your right. In this method, we will only consider the circle on the left because the circle on the right will be considered when you walk from \nq\n to \np\n. See figure below.\n\n\n\n\nHint: To find the center \n\\(c\\)\n of the new circle, you can first find the midpoint \n\\(m\\)\n of line \n\\(pq\\)\n, the length of line \n\\(mc\\)\n, and the angle between \n\\(m\\)\n and \n\\(c\\)\n, using the \nPoint\n methods you have written.  We also know that length of \n\\(cq\\)\n is \nradius\n.  See figure below.\n\n\n\n\nThe constructor should return a \nCircle\n with \nDouble.NaN\n as the radius and (0,0) as center if the distance between \np\n and \nq\n is larger than 2x\nradius\n or is zero\n2\n.  Such \nCircle\n objects are invalid, and you may want to add a method in the \nCircle\n class to check for validity.  You can use \nDouble.isNaN\n for check if a double variable is NaN.\n\n\n3. Maximum Disc Coverage\n\n\nWe are now going to use the \nCircle\n class and \nPoint\n class to solve the maximum disc coverage problem.  In this problem, we are given a set of points on a 2D plane, and a unit disc (i.e., a circle of radius 1).  We want to place the disc so that it covers as many points as possible.  What is the maximum number of points that we can cover with the disc at any one time?   \n\n\nWe will use the following simple (non-optimal)  algorithm\n3\n.  First, some observations:\n\n\n\n\nA disc that covers the maximum number of points must pass through at least two points.\n\n\nFor every pair of points that is of no more than distance 2 away from each other, there is at most two unit discs that have their perimeter passing through the two points (you have written a constructor that helps you to find such circles).\n\n\n\n\nSo, the algorithm simply goes through every pair of points, and for each circle that passes through them, count how many points are covered by each circle.\n\n\nThe skeleton of the main class, called \nLabZero.java\n has been given to you.  The file \nMaxDiscCover.java\n, also given, is where you will implement tha maximum disc coverage solution .  These two files are placed in the same directory as \nCircle.java\n and \nPoint.java\n.  \n\n\nThe skeleton code reads a set of points from the standard input, in the following format:\n\n\n\n\nThe first line is an integer, indicating the number of points \n\\(n\\)\n (\n\\(n\\)\n > 2) in the file.\n\n\nThe next \n\\(n\\)\n lines contains the \n\\(x\\)\n and \n\\(y\\)\n coordinates of \n\\(n\\)\n points, one point per line.

In this problem, we are given a set of points on a 2D plane, and a unit disc (i.e., a circle of radius 1).  We want to place the disc so that it covers as many points as possible.  What is the maximum number of points that we can cover with the disc at any one time?     We will use the following simple (non-optimal)  algorithm 3 .  First, some observations:   A disc that covers the maximum number of points must pass through at least two points.  For every pair of points that is of no more than distance 2 away from each other, there is at most two unit discs that have their perimeter passing through the two points (you have written a constructor that helps you to find such circles).   So, the algorithm simply goes through every pair of points, and for each circle that passes through them, count how many points are covered by each circle.  The skeleton of the main class, called  LabZero.java  has been given to you.  The file  MaxDiscCover.java , also given, is where you will implement tha maximum disc coverage solution .  These two files are placed in the same directory as  Circle.java  and  Point.java .    The skeleton code reads a set of points from the standard input, in the following format:   The first line is an integer, indicating the number of points  \\(n\\)  ( \\(n\\)  > 2) in the file.  The next  \\(n\\)  lines contains the  \\(x\\)  and  \\(y\\)  coordinates of  \\(n\\)  points, one point per line.  Each line has two doubles, separated by space.  The first double is the  \\(x\\)  coordinate; the second double is the  \\(y\\)  coordinate.   You can assume that the format of the input is always correct and there is always at least two points with distance less than 2 between them.

In other words, be more comfortable with creating own encapsulated class.\n\n\nbe more comfortable with basic Java syntax and semantics, particularly when creating classes from scratch.\n\n\nbe comfortable with following a given coding convention.\n\n\n\n\nSetup\n\n\nLogin to \ncs2030-i\n, copy the files from \n~cs2030/lab1a\n to your local directory under your home \n~/lab1a\n.  You should see one java file (\nLabOneA.java\n) and a few data files (\nTESTDATA1.txt\n, \nTESTDATA2.txt\n, ..., \nTESTDATA5.txt\n)\n\n\nGoals\n\n\nLabOneA.java\n implements a working discrete event simulator that simulates customers being served by a server.  It is written in procedural style with \nno encapsulation\n.  The goal, in this lab, is to rewrite this simulator with OO style, by properly using encapsulation to create abstraction barriers to the various variables and methods.  Here and some hints:\n\n\n\n\nThink about the problem that you are solving: what are the nouns?  These are good candidates for classes. \n\n\nFor each class, what are the attributes/properties relevant to the class?  These are good candidates for fields in the class.\n\n\nFor each class, what are their responsibilities?  What can they \ndo\n?  These are good candidates for methods in the class.\n\n\nHow do the objects of each class interact?  These are good candidates for public methods.\n\n\n\n\nNote that the goal of this lab and, and of CS2030 in general, is \nNOT\n to solve the problem with the cleverest and the shortest piece of code possible.  For instance, you might notice that you can solve Lab 1a with only a few variables and an array.  But such solution is hard to extend and modify.  In CS2030, our goal is to produce a software that can easily evolve and be modified, with a reduced risk of introducing bugs while doing so.\n\n\nNote that Lab 1a is the first of a series of labs, where we introduce new requirements or modify existing ones in every lab (not \nunlike what software engineers face in the real world\n).  We will slowly evolve the simulator into something more general and will simulate a more complex server and customer behaviors in our simulation.\n\n\nThus, making sure that your code will be able to adapt to new problem statements is the key.  Trying to solve the lab without considering this (such as coming up with a solution that computes the average waiting time in only tens of lines of code) and you will likely find yourself painted into a corner and have to re-write much of your solution to handle the new requirement.\n\n\nGrading\n\n\nThis lab is not graded.  But, it will be extended to Lab 1b, which is graded.  Coming out with a good encapsulation will make your Lab 1b much easier to solve. \nYou may be tempted to wait for Lab 1b to be released and solve Lab 1a and 1b together -- unless you are very sure you can handle it, do not do this.  The purpose of Lab 1a is to give you enough time to ponder \nover different designs and get feedback from your Lab TAs.\n\n\nDiscrete Event Simulator\n\n\nA discrete event simulator is a software that simulates a system (often modeled after the real world) with events and states.  An event occurs at a particular time, and each event alters the states of the system and may generate more events.  A discrete event simulator can be used to study many complex real-world systems.  The term \ndiscrete\n refers to the fact that, the states remain unchanged between two events, and therefore, the simulator can \njump\n from the time of one event to another, instead of following the clock in real time.  The simulator typically keeps track of some statistics to measure the performance of the system.\n\n\nIn this lab, we start with simulating a specific situation:\n\n\n\n\nWe have a shop with a \nserver\n (a person providing service to the customer).\n\n\nThe server can serve one customer at a time.\n\n\nWe assume for now that the server takes constant time to serve a customer.\n  The time taken to serve is called \nservice time\n.\n\n\nWhen a customer arrives:\n\n\nif the server is idle (not serving any customer), then the server serves the customer immediately (no waiting).\n\n\nif the server is serving another customer, then the customer that just arrives waits.\n\n\nif the server is serving one customer, and another customer is waiting, then the customer that just arrives just leave (no waiting) and go elsewhere.  In other words, there is at most one waiting customer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen the server is done serving a customer:\n\n\nthe served customer leaves.\n\n\nif there is another customer waiting, the server starts serving the waiting customer immediately.\n\n\nif there is no waiting customer, then server becomes idle again.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe are interested in the following.  Given a sequence of customer arrivals (time of each arrival is given):\n\n\n\n\nWhat is the average waiting time for customers that have been served?\n\n\nHow many customers are served?\n\n\nHow many customers left without being served?\n\n\n\n\nIn your Lab 1a, you are given a simple discrete event simulator to answer the questions above.  There are two classes: \nSimulator\n and \nEvent\n.\n\n\nClass \nEvent\n\n\nThe event class is written in a procedural style, not unlike a \nstruct\n in C.  All members are public, and there is no method.  Each \nEvent\n keeps track of two information: the \ntime\n the event occurs, and \neventType\n, which signifies what type of events is this.  Instead of using time like 9:45 pm, we simply and represent time as a double value.\n\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n  \nstatic\n \nclass\n \nEvent\n \n{\n\n    \npublic\n \ndouble\n \ntime\n;\n \n// The time this event will occur\n\n    \npublic\n \nint\n \neventType\n;\n \n// The type of event, indicates what should happen when an event occurs. \n\n  \n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe handle two types of events for this particular scenario: an event of type \nCUSTOMER_ARRIVE\n means that a customer arrives during this event; while an event of type \nCUSTOMER_DONE\n means that the customer is done being served.  \nCUSTOMER_ARRIVE\n events are created based on the given input.  \nCUSTOMER_DONE\n events are created and scheduled to occur sometime in the future when a customer is being served.\n\n\n1\n2\n  \npublic\n \nstatic\n \nfinal\n \nint\n \nCUSTOMER_ARRIVE\n \n=\n \n1\n;\n\n  \npublic\n \nstatic\n \nfinal\n \nint\n \nCUSTOMER_DONE\n \n=\n \n2\n;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClass \nSimulator\n\n\nThe simulator class is again written in procedural style.  All members are public, and there is no method.\n\n\nThe \nSimulator\n class contains two configuration parameters, \nMAX_NUMBER_OF_EVENTS\n indicates the maximum number of events that the simulator can store at one time; \nSERVICE_TIME\n indicates the time the server takes to serve a customer.\n\n1\n2\n    \npublic\n \nstatic\n \nfinal\n \nint\n \nMAX_NUMBER_OF_EVENTS\n \n=\n \n100\n;\n \n// Maximum number of events\n\n    \npublic\n \nstatic\n \nfinal\n \ndouble\n \nSERVICE_TIME\n \n=\n \n1.0\n;\n \n// Time spent serving a customer\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe \nevents\n is an array of \nEvent\n that store all events scheduled for the future in the simulator.\n\n1\n2\n    \npublic\n \nEvent\n[]\n \nevents\n;\n \n// Array of events, order of events not guaranteed.\n\n    \npublic\n \nint\n \nnumOfEvents\n;\n \n// The number of events in the event array.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe simulator needs to keep track of three states:\n\n\n\n\nis a customer being served?\n\n\nis a customer waiting?\n\n\nif a customer is waiting, when did he start waiting?\n\n\n\n\nThese states are represented as:\n\n\n1\n2\n3\n    \npublic\n \nboolean\n \ncustomerBeingServed\n;\n \n// is a customer currently being served?\n\n    \npublic\n \nboolean\n \ncustomerWaiting\n;\n \n// is a customer currently waiting?\n\n    \npublic\n \ndouble\n \ntimeStartedWaiting\n;\n \n// the time the current waiting customer started waiting\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRemember we are interested in the following statistics:\n\n\n\n\nWhat is the average waiting time for customers that have been served?\n\n\nHow many customers are served?\n\n\nHow many customers left without being served?\n\n\n\n\nwhich can be computed from the following members:\n\n\n1\n2\n3\n    \npublic\n \ndouble\n \ntotalWaitingTime\n;\n \n// total time everyone spent waiting\n\n    \npublic\n \nint\n \ntotalNumOfServedCustomer\n;\n \n// how many customer has waited\n\n    \npublic\n \nint\n \ntotalNumOfLostCustomer\n;\n \n// how many customer has been lost\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFinally, for debugging purposes, the simulator assigns unique IDs 1, 2, 3, ... to the customers, in the order of their arrivals.  It then keeps track of the ID of the customer being served (if any) and the customer waiting to be served.\n\n\n1\n2\n3\n    \npublic\n \nint\n \nlastCustomerId\n;\n \n// starts from 0 and increases as customer arrives.\n\n    \npublic\n \nint\n \nservedCustomerId\n;\n \n// id of the customer being served, if any\n\n    \npublic\n \nint\n \nwaitingCustomerId\n;\n \n// id of the customer currently waiting, if any\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInteraction between \nSimulator\n and \nEvent\n\n\nWe create a \nSimulator\n by calling the method:\n\n1\n  \nstatic\n \nSimulator\n \ncreateSimulator\n()\n \n{..}\n\n\n\n\n\nand an \nEvent\n by calling the method, specifying \nwhen\n the event will occur, and the \ntype\n of the event.\n\n1\n  \nstatic\n \nEvent\n \ncreateEvent\n(\ndouble\n \nwhen\n,\n \nint\n \ntype\n)\n  \n{..}\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can schedule the event \ne\n to be executed by simulator \nsim\n by calling:\n\n1\n  \nstatic\n \nboolean\n \nscheduleEventInSimulator\n(\nEvent\n \ne\n,\n \nSimulator\n \nsim\n)\n \n{..}\n\n\n\n\n\nThis method will return \ntrue\n if the event is scheduled successfully, \nfalse\n if the simulator run out of space to store the event (i.e., \nMAX_NUMBER_OF_EVENTS\n is reached).\n\n\nWe always execute the events in increasing sequence of their time.

There are four methods being called from here:\n\n\n\n\nserveCustomer(sim, time, id)\n: called to start serving a customer with ID \nid\n\n\nmakeCustomerWait(sim, time, id)\n: called to make the customer with ID \nid\n wait\n\n\ncustomerLeaves(sim, time, id)\n: called when the customer with ID \nid\n who just arrived leaves immediately (as someone else is waiting)\n\n\nservedWaitingCustomer(sim, time)\n: called to start serving the customer that is currently waiting.\n\n\n\n\nYou should read through \nLabOneA.java\n and clarify if you are not sure about any part of the given code.\n\n\nInput and Output\n\n\nThe input consists of a sequence of double values, each is the arrival time of a customer (in any order).  We can read from standard input (if no command line argument is given)\n\n1\n2\njava LabOneA\njava LabOneA  < TESTDATA1.txt\n\n\n\n\nor read from a given filename\n\n1\njava LabOneA TESTDATA1\n\n\n\n\n\nGiven an input, the output might not be deterministic, since if two events occur at exactly the same time, we break the ties arbitrarily.  For this reason, we will only test your code with input where no two events occur at exactly the same time.\n\n\nThe test cases and outputs\n1\n should be:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTest Case\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1\n\n\n0.000 1 0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2\n\n\n0.000 4 0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3\n\n\n0.450 2 8\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4\n\n\n0.614 7 0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5\n\n\n0.405 76 24\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote that the skeleton we gave to you already produces the output above.  You just need to ensure that after changing the code to OO style, the output remains the same.  Of course, as usual, producing the correct output for five test cases does not guarantee that your code is correct.\n\n\nYour Task\n\n\nThe given \nLabOneA.java\n is written in C style, no minimal encapsulation.  As you read through the code, you should appreciate how messy and difficult to understand the code is.\n\n\nYour mission, in Lab 2, is to rewrite the code using encapsulation, applying OO paradigm, properly maintain the abstraction barrier when the objects interact.  See the Section on Goals above.  Here are some rules:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can add as many classes as you like.  Each class must be in its own \n.java\n file\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe \nmain\n method should remain in a class named \nLabOneA\n.  We must be able to run your code with:\n\n1\n2\njavac *.java\njava LabOneA < TESTDATA1.txt\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou must not change the formatting of the \nlast line\n of output (\nSystem.out.printf(\"%.3f %d %d\", ..\")\n).

We will test compile and test run with a tiny sample input to make sure that your submission is OK.\n\n\nWe will run \ncheckstyle\n to check your code against the CS2030 Java Coding Convention upon submission. \n\n\nThis lab is not graded.  But do submit anyway so that we have a record that you have done the lab.\n\n\nTo get individual feedback on your lab solution, please talk to your lab TAs.\n\n\nExtra Java Stuff\n\n\nYou are exposed to three new Java syntax/class in this Lab:\n\n\n\n\nNested classes: In the code given to you, we define \nSimulator\n and \nEvent\n within the class \nLabOneA\n.

We can group logically relevant classes together.\n\n\nassert\n keyword: \nassert\n works like in C and Python.  You use \nassert\n to check for conditions that have to be true in your code.  If an assertion fails, the program will bail, informing you what went wrong.  This is useful to catch bugs quickly.  Use this by passing a \n-ea\n (enable assertions) flag when running a Java program e.g. \njava -ea LabOneA TESTDATA1.txt\n\n\nFileReader\n: a useful class for reading a stream of characters from a file.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter piping through \ntail\n (e.g., \njava LabOneA < TESTDATA1.txt | tail -1\n)\u00a0\n\u21a9",

The goal, in this lab, is to rewrite this simulator with OO style, by properly using encapsulation to create abstraction barriers to the various variables and methods.  Here and some hints:   Think about the problem that you are solving: what are the nouns?  These are good candidates for classes.   For each class, what are the attributes/properties relevant to the class?  These are good candidates for fields in the class.  For each class, what are their responsibilities?  What can they  do ?  These are good candidates for methods in the class.  How do the objects of each class interact?  These are good candidates for public methods.   Note that the goal of this lab and, and of CS2030 in general, is  NOT  to solve the problem with the cleverest and the shortest piece of code possible.  For instance, you might notice that you can solve Lab 1a with only a few variables and an array.  But such solution is hard to extend and modify.  In CS2030, our goal is to produce a software that can easily evolve and be modified, with a reduced risk of introducing bugs while doing so.  Note that Lab 1a is the first of a series of labs, where we introduce new requirements or modify existing ones in every lab (not  unlike what software engineers face in the real world ).  We will slowly evolve the simulator into something more general and will simulate a more complex server and customer behaviors in our simulation.  Thus, making sure that your code will be able to adapt to new problem statements is the key.  Trying to solve the lab without considering this (such as coming up with a solution that computes the average waiting time in only tens of lines of code) and you will likely find yourself painted into a corner and have to re-write much of your solution to handle the new requirement.",

An event occurs at a particular time, and each event alters the states of the system and may generate more events.  A discrete event simulator can be used to study many complex real-world systems.  The term  discrete  refers to the fact that, the states remain unchanged between two events, and therefore, the simulator can  jump  from the time of one event to another, instead of following the clock in real time.  The simulator typically keeps track of some statistics to measure the performance of the system.  In this lab, we start with simulating a specific situation:   We have a shop with a  server  (a person providing service to the customer).  The server can serve one customer at a time.  We assume for now that the server takes constant time to serve a customer.\n  The time taken to serve is called  service time .  When a customer arrives:  if the server is idle (not serving any customer), then the server serves the customer immediately (no waiting).  if the server is serving another customer, then the customer that just arrives waits.  if the server is serving one customer, and another customer is waiting, then the customer that just arrives just leave (no waiting) and go elsewhere.  In other words, there is at most one waiting customer.    When the server is done serving a customer:  the served customer leaves.  if there is another customer waiting, the server starts serving the waiting customer immediately.  if there is no waiting customer, then server becomes idle again.     We are interested in the following.  Given a sequence of customer arrivals (time of each arrival is given):   What is the average waiting time for customers that have been served?  How many customers are served?  How many customers left without being served?   In your Lab 1a, you are given a simple discrete event simulator to answer the questions above.

A programming language is a formal language that helps programmers specify precisely what are the instructions we issue to computers, using code that are often made up of keywords, symbols, and names.  Computers execute the instructions in their \nprocessing units\n, and store the instructions and data in their \nmemory\n1\n.  The processing units recognize the instructions based on the specific patterns of bits and manipulate data as a sequence of bits.  A programming language, however, is written at a higher level of \nabstraction\n (i.e., at a higher conceptual level), so that as a programmer, we only need to write a few lines of code to give complex instructions to the computer.  A \ncompiler\n or \ninterpreter\n is responsible for translating these programs written in high level language to \nassembly code\n or \nmachine code\n, i.e., bit patterns that the processing units can understand.\n\n\nThere are thousands of programming languages in existence.  \nC\n is one of the languages that is a \nlow-level language\n -- i.e., it provides a very thin layer of abstractions on top of machine code.  On the other hand, languages such as \nPython\n and \nJavaScript\n are high-level languages.  As an example, in C, you can directly manage memory allocation.  In JavaScript and Python, you cannot.\n\n\nAbstraction: Variable and Type\n\n\nOne of the important abstractions that is provided by a programming language is \nvariable\n.  Data are stored in some location in the computer memory.  But we should not be referring to the memory location all the time.  First, referring to something like \n0xFA49130E\n is not user-friendly; Second, the location may change.  A \nvariable\n is an abstraction that allows us to give a user-friendly name to a piece of data in memory.  We use the \nvariable name\n whenever we want to access the \nvalue\n in that location, and \npointer to the variable\n or \nreference to the variable\n whenever we want to refer to the address of the location.\n\n\nLet's think a bit more about how a sequence of bits is abstracted as data in a programming language.  At the machine level, these bits are just, well, bits.  We give the bits a \nsemantic\n at the program level, e.g., we want to interpret the sequence of bits as numbers, letters, etc.  E.g., the number (integer, to be exact) \n65\n and the letter \nA\n all share the same sequence of bits \n0100 0001\n but are interpreted differently and possibly manipulated differently.  \n\n\nThe \ntype\n of a variable tells the compiler or the interpreter how to interpret the variable and how to manipulate the variable.  \n\n\nFor instance, supposed that in Python, if you have two variables \nx\n and \ny\n storing the values \n4\n and \n5\n respectively, if you \nprint x + y\n, you would get \n45\n if \nx\n and \ny\n are strings; you would get \n9\n if \nx\n and \ny\n are integers; you would get an error if \n4\n is an integer and \n5\n is a string.  \n\n\nIn the last instance above, you see that assigning a type to each variable helps to keep the program meaningful, as the operation \n+\n is not defined over an integer and a string in Python\n2\n.\n\n\nPython is a \ndynamically typed\n language.  The same variable can hold values of different types, and checking if the right type is used is done during the execution of the program.  Note that, the type is associated with the \nvalues\n, and the type of the variable changes depending on the value it holds.\n\n\nC, on the other hand, is a \nstatically typed\n language.  We need to \ndeclare\n every variable we use in the program and specify its type.  A variable can only hold values of the same type as the type of the variable, so we can't assign, for instance, a string to a variable of type \nint\n.  We check if the right type is used during the compilation of the program.\n\n\n1\n2\nint\n \nx\n \n=\n \n4\n;\n \n// ok\n\n\nint\n \ny\n \n=\n \n\"5\"\n;\n \n// error\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy annotating each variable with its type, the C compiler also knows how much memory space is needed to store a variable.  \n\n\nAbstraction: Functions\n\n\nAnother important abstraction provided by a programming language is \nfunction\n (or \nprocedure\n).  This abstraction allows programmers to group a set of instructions and give it a name.  The named set of instructions may take one or more variables as input parameters, and return one or more values.   \n\n\nLike all other abstractions, defining functions allow us to think at a higher conceptual level.  By composing functions at increasingly higher level of abstractions, we can build programs with increasing level of complexity.\n\n\nDefining functions allow us to abstract away the implementation details from the caller.  Once a function is defined, we can change the way the function is implemented without affecting the code that calls the function, as long as the semantic and the \ninterface\n of the function remains the same.\n\n\nFunction, therefore, is a critical mechanism for achieving \nseparation of concerns\n in a program.  We separate the concerns about how a particular function is implemented, from the concerns about how the function is used to perform a higher-level task.\n\n\nDefining functions also allow us to \nreuse\n code.  We do not have to repeatedly write the same chunk of code if we group the sequence of code into a function -- then we just need to call the function to invoke this sequence of code every time we need it.  If this chunk of code is properly written and debugged, then we can be pretty sure that everywhere the function is invoked, the code is correct\n3\n.\n\n\nC is a \nprocedural language\n.  A C program consists of functions, with the \nmain()\n function serves as the entry point to the program.  Since C is a statically typed language, a C function has a return type, and each  function parameter (or \nargument\n) has a type as well.  (Note that this statement does not mean that a C function must return a \nvalue\n.  If the function does not return a value, we define its return type as \nvoid\n.)\n\n\nRecall that the bits representing the instructions are also stored in the computer memory in an area separated from the data.  The instructions that belong to the same function are stored in adjacent memory locations.  Just like we can refer to a variable using its memory address through its \nreference\n (or \npointer\n), we can refer to a function using the memory address of the entry point to the function.\n\n\nAbstraction: Composite Data Type\n\n\nJust like functions allow programmers to group instructions, give it a name, and refer to it later, a \ncomposite data type\n allows programmers to group \nprimitive types\n together, give it a name (a new type), and refer to it later.  This is another powerful abstraction in programming languages that help us to think at a higher conceptual level without worrying about the details.   Commonly used examples are mathematical objects such as complex numbers, 2D data points, multi-dimensional vectors, circles, etc, or every day objects such as a person, a product, etc.\n\n\nDefining composite data type allows programmers to abstract away (and be separated from the concern of) how a complex data type is represented.\n\n\nFor instance, a circle on a 2D plane can be represented by the center (\nx\n, \ny\n) and its radius \nr\n, or it can be represented by the top left corner (\nx\n,\ny\n) and the width \nw\n of the bounding square.\n\n\nIn C, we build composite data type with \nstruct\n.  For example,\n\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\nstruct\n \ncircle\n \n{\n\n  \nfloat\n \nx\n,\n \ny\n;\n \n// (x,y) coordinate of the center.\n\n  \nfloat\n \nr\n;\n \n// radius\n\n\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOnce we have the \nstruct\n defined, we are not completely shielded from its representation, until we write a set of functions that operates on the \ncircle\n composite type.  For instance,\n\n\n1\n2\n3\nfloat\n \ncircle_area\n(\ncircle\n \nc\n)\n \n{\n \n...\n \n};\n\n\nbool\n  \ncircle_contains_point\n(\ncircle\n \nc\n,\n \npoint\n \np\n)\n \n{\n \n...\n \n};\n\n  \n:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImplementing these functions obviously requires the knowledge of how a circle is represented.  Once the set of functions that operates on and manipulates circles is available, we can use \ncircle\n type without worrying about the internal representation.  \n\n\nIf we decide to change the representation of a circle, then only the set of functions that operates on a circle type need to be changed, but not the code that uses circles to do other things.\n\n\nWe can imagine an \nabstraction barrier\n between the code that uses a composite data type along with its associated set of functions, and the code that define the data type along with the implementation of the functions.  Above the barrier, the concern is about using the composite data type to do useful things, while below the barrier, the concern is about how to represent and manipulate the composite data type.\n\n\nWhile many of you are used to writing a program solo, in practice, you rarely write a program with contributions from a single person.  The abstraction barrier separates the role of the programmer into two: (i) an \nimplementer\n, which define that data type and provide the implementation, and (ii) a \nclient\n, which uses the composite data type to perform a higher level task\n4\n.  Part of my aim in CS2030 is to switch your mindset into thinking in terms of these two roles.  Note that the implementer and the client may very well be the same programmer.\n\n\nAbstraction: Class and Object (or, Encapsulation)\n\n\nWe can further bundle the composite data type and its associated functions together in another abstraction, called a \nclass\n.  A class is a data type with a group of functions associated with it.  We call the functions as \nmethods\n and the data in the class as \nfields\n (or \nmembers\n, or \nstates\n, or \nattributes\n4\n).   A well-designed class maintains the abstraction barrier, properly wraps the barrier around the internal representation and implementation, and exposes just the right \ninterface\n for others to use.\n\n\nJust like we can create variables of a given type, we can create \nobjects\n of a given class.  Objects are \ninstances\n of a class, each allowing the same methods to be called, and each containing the same set of variables of the same types, but (possibly) storing different values.\n\n\nRecall that programs written in a procedural language such as a C consists of functions, with a \nmain()\n function as the entry point.  A program written in an \nobject-oriented language\n such as Java consists of classes, with one main class as the entry point.  One can view a running object-oriented (or OO) program as something that instantiates objects of different classes and orchestrates their interactions with each other by calling each others' methods.\n\n\nOne could argue that an object-oriented way of writing programs is much more natural, as it mirrors our world more closely.  If we look around us, we see objects all around us, and each object has certain properties, exhibit certain behavior, and they allow certain actions.  We interact with the objects through their interfaces, and we rarely need to know the internals of the objects we used everyday (unless we try to repair it)\n5\n.  \n\n\nThe concept of keeping all the data and functions operating on the data related to a composite data type together within an abstraction barrier is called \nencapsulation\n.\n\n\nBreaking the Abstraction Barrier\n\n\nIn the ideal case, the code above the abstraction barrier would just call the provided interface to use the composite data type.  There, however, may be cases where a programmer may intentionally or accidentally break the abstraction barrier.  \n\n\nConsider the case of implementing \ncircle\n as a C \nstruct\n.  Suppose someone wants to move the center of the circle \nc\n to a new position (\nx\n, \ny\n), instead of implementing a function \ncircle_move_to(c, x, y)\n (which would still keep the representation used under the barrier), the person wrote:\n\n\n1\n2\nc\n.\nx\n \n=\n \nx\n;\n\n\nc\n.\ny\n \n=\n \ny\n;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis code would still be correct, but the abstraction barrier is broken since we now make explicit assumption that there are two variables \nx\n and \ny\n inside the \ncircle\n data type that corresponds to the center of the circle.  If one day, we want to represent a circle differently, then we have to carefully change all the code that read and write these variables \nx\n and \ny\n and update them.\n\n\n\n\nBreaking Python's Abstraction Barrier\n\n\nPython tries to prevent \naccidental\n access to internal representation by having a convention of prefixing the internal variables with \n_\n (one underscore) or \n__\n (two underscores).   This method, however, does not prevent a lazy programmer from directly accessing the variables and possibly planting a bug/error that will surface later.\n\n\n\n\nData Hiding\n\n\nMany OO languages allow programmers to explicitly specify if a field or a method can be accessed from outside the abstraction barrier.  Java, for instance, supports \nprivate\n and \npublic\n access modifiers\n5\n.  A field or a method that is declared as \nprivate\n cannot be accessed from outside the class, and can only be accessed within the class.  On the other hand, as you can guess, a \npublic\n field or method can be accessed, modified, or invoked from outside the class.\n\n\nSuch mechanism to protect the abstraction barrier from being broken is called \ndata hiding\n or \ninformation hiding\n.  This protection is enforced by the \ncompiler\n at compile time.\n\n\nExample: The Circle class\n\n\nLet's put together the concepts of encapsulation and data hiding to define a \nCircle\n class in Java:\n\n\n 1\n 2\n 3\n 4\n 5\n 6\n 7\n 8\n 9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n/**\n\n\n * A Circle object encapsulates a circle on a 2D plane.  \n\n\n */\n\n\nclass\n \nCircle\n \n{\n\n  \nprivate\n \ndouble\n \nx\n;\n  \n// x-coordinate of the center\n\n  \nprivate\n \ndouble\n \ny\n;\n  \n// y-coordinate of the center\n\n  \nprivate\n \ndouble\n \nr\n;\n  \n// the length of the radius\n\n\n  \n/**\n\n\n   * Return the area of the circle.\n\n\n   */\n\n  \npublic\n \ndouble\n \ngetArea\n()\n \n{\n\n    \nreturn\n \n3.1415926\n \n*\n \nr\n \n*\n \nr\n;\n\n  \n}\n\n\n  \n/**\n\n\n   * Move the center of the circle to the new position (newX, newY)\n\n\n   */\n\n  \npublic\n \nvoid\n \nmoveTo\n(\ndouble\n \nnewX\n,\n \ndouble\n \nnewY\n)\n \n{\n\n    \nx\n \n=\n \nnewX\n;\n\n    \ny\n \n=\n \nnewY\n;\n\n  \n}\n\n\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere, we define \nx\n, \ny\n, and \nr\n as three private fields inside the class \nCircle\n.  Note that these fields are not accessible and modifiable outside of the class \nCircle\n, but they can be accessed and modified within \nCircle\n (inside the abstraction barrier), such as in the methods \ngetArea\n and \nmoveTo\n.\n\n\nConstructors, Accessors, and Mutators\n\n\nWith data hiding, we completely isolate the internal representation of a class using an abstraction barrier.  With no way for the user of the class to modify the fields directly, it is common for a class to provide methods to initialize and modify these internal fields (such as the \nmoveTo()\n method above).  A method that initializes an object is called a \nconstructor\n, and a method that retrieves or modifies the properties of the object is called the \naccessor\n (or \ngetter\n) or \nmutator\n (or \nsetter\n).\n\n\nA constructor method is a special method within the class.  It cannot be called directly but is invoked automatically when an object is instantiated.   In Java, a constructor method \nhas the same name as the class\n and \nhas no return type\n.  A constructor can take in arguments just like other functions.  The class \nCircle\n can have a constructor such as the following:\n\n\n 1\n 2\n 3\n 4\n 5\n 6\n 7\n 8\n 9\n10\n11\n12\nclass\n \nCircle\n \n{\n\n    \n:\n\n  \n/**\n\n\n   * Create a circle centered on (centerX, centerY) with given radius\n\n\n  */\n\n  \npublic\n \nCircle\n(\ndouble\n \ncenterX\n,\n \ndouble\n \ncenterY\n,\n \ndouble\n \nradius\n)\n \n{\n\n    \nx\n \n=\n \ncenterX\n;\n\n    \ny\n \n=\n \ncenterY\n;\n\n    \nr\n \n=\n \nradius\n;\n\n  \n}\n\n    \n:\n\n\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe use of accessor and mutator methods is a bit controversial.   Suppose that we provide an accessor method and a mutator method for every private field, then we are actually exposing the internal representation, therefore breaking the encapsulation.  For instance:\n\n\n 1\n 2\n 3\n 4\n 5\n 6\n 7\n 8\n 9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\nclass\n \nCircle\n \n{\n\n    \n:\n\n\n  \npublic\n \ndouble\n \ngetX\n()\n \n{\n\n    \nreturn\n \nx\n;\n\n  \n}\n\n\n  \npublic\n \nvoid\n \nsetX\n(\ndouble\n \nnewX\n)\n \n{\n\n    \nx\n \n=\n \nnewX\n;\n\n  \n}\n\n\n  \npublic\n \ndouble\n \ngetY\n()\n \n{\n\n    \nreturn\n \ny\n;\n\n  \n}\n\n\n  \npublic\n \nvoid\n \nsetY\n(\ndouble\n \nnewY\n)\n \n{\n\n    \ny\n \n=\n \nnewY\n:\n\n  \n}\n\n\n  \npublic\n \ndouble\n \ngetR\n()\n \n{\n\n    \nreturn\n \nr\n;\n\n  \n}\n\n\n  \npublic\n \nvoid\n \nsetR\n(\ndouble\n \nnewR\n)\n \n{\n\n    \nr\n \n=\n \nnewR\n;\n\n  \n}\n\n    \n:\n\n\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe examples above are pretty pointless.  If we need to know the internal and do something with it, we are doing it wrong.  The right approach is to implement a method within the class that do whatever we want the class to do.   For instance, suppose that we want to know the circumference of the circle \nc\n, one approach would be:\n\n\n1\n   \ndouble\n \ncircumference\n \n=\n \n2\n*\nc\n.\ngetR\n()*\n3.1415926\n;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwhere \nc\n is a \nCircle\n object.\n\n\nA better approach would be to add a new method \ngetCircumference()\n in the \nCircle\n class, and call it instead:\n\n1\n   \ndouble\n \ncircumference\n \n=\n \nc\n.\ngetCircumference\n();\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe better approach involves writing a few more lines of code to implement the method, but it keeps the encapsulation intact.  If one fine day, the implementer of \nCircle\n decided to store the diameter of the circle instead of the radius, then only the implementer needs to change the implementation of \ngetCircumference\n.  The client does not have to change anything.  \n\n\n\n\nConstructor in Python and JavaScript\n\n\nIn Python, the constructor is the \n__init__\n method.   In JavaScript, the constructor is simply called \nconstructor\n.\n\n\n\n\nClass Fields and Methods\n\n\nLet's look at the implementation of \ngetArea()\n above.  We use the constant \n\\(\\pi\\)\n but hardcoded it as 3.1415926.  Hardcoding such a magic number is a \nno-no\n in terms of coding style.  This constant can appear in more than one places. If we hardcode such a number and want to change its precision later, we would need to trace down and change every occurrence.  Every time we need to use \n\\(\\pi\\)\n, we have to remember or look up what is the precision that we use.  Not only does this practice introduce more work, it is also likely to introduce bugs.  \n\n\nIn C, we define \n\\(\\pi\\)\n as a macro constant \nM_PI\n.  But how should we do this in Java?  This is where the ideal that a program consists of only objects with internal states that communicate with each other feel a bit constraining.  The constant \n\\(\\pi\\)\n is universal, and does not really belong to any object (the value of \n\\(\\pi\\)\n is the same for every circle!).  Another example: if we define a method \nsqrt()\n that computes the square root of a given number, this is a general function that is not associated with any object as well.\n\n\nA solution to this is to associate these \nglobal\n values and functions with a \nclass\n instead of with an \nobject\n.  For instance. Java predefines a \nMath\n class\n6\n that is populated with constants \nPI\n and \nE\n (for Euler's number \n\\(e\\)\n), along with a long list of mathematical functions.  To associate a method or a field with a class in Java, we declare them with the \nstatic\n keyword.  We can additionally add a keyword \nfinal\n to indicate that the value of the field will not change\n7\n.\n\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\nclass\n \nMath\n \n{\n\n  \n:\n\n  \npublic\n \nstatic\n \nfinal\n \ndouble\n \nPI\n \n=\n \n3.141592653589793\n;\n\n  \n:\n\n  \n:\n\n\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe call these fields and methods that are associated with a class as \nclass fields\n and \nclass methods\n, and fields and methods that are associated with an object as \ninstance fields\n and \ninstance methods\n.\n\n\n\n\nClass Fields and Methods in Python\n\n\nNote that, in Python, any variable declared within a \nclass\n block is a class field:\n\n1\n2\n3\nclass\n \nCircle\n:\n\n  \nx\n \n=\n \n0\n\n  \ny\n \n=\n \n0\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the above example, \nx\n and \ny\n are class fields, not instance fields.\n\n\n\n\nExample: The Circle class\n\n\nNow, let revise our \nCircle\n class to improve the code and make it a little more complete:\n\n\n 1\n 2\n 3\n 4\n 5\n 6\n 7\n 8\n 9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\n32\n33\n34\n35\n36\n37\n38\n39\n40\n41\n42\n43\n44\n45\n46\n47\n48\n49\nimport\n \njava.lang.Math\n;\n\n\n\n/**\n\n\n * A Circle object encapsulates a circle on a 2D plane.  \n\n\n */\n\n\nclass\n \nCircle\n \n{\n\n  \nprivate\n \ndouble\n \nx\n;\n  \n// x-coordinate of the center\n\n  \nprivate\n \ndouble\n \ny\n;\n  \n// y-coordinate of the center\n\n  \nprivate\n \ndouble\n \nr\n;\n  \n// the length of the radius\n\n\n  \n/**\n\n\n   * Create a circle centered on (centerX, centerY) with given radius\n\n\n  */\n\n  \npublic\n \nCircle\n(\ndouble\n \ncenterX\n,\n \ndouble\n \ncenterY\n,\n \ndouble\n \nradius\n)\n \n{\n\n    \nx\n \n=\n \ncenterX\n;\n\n    \ny\n \n=\n \ncenterY\n;\n\n    \nr\n \n=\n \nradius\n;\n\n  \n}\n\n\n  \n/**\n\n\n   * Return the area of the circle.\n\n\n   */\n\n  \npublic\n \ndouble\n \ngetArea\n()\n \n{\n\n    \nreturn\n \nMath\n.\nPI\n*\nr\n*\nr\n;\n\n  \n}\n\n\n  \n/**\n\n\n   * Return the circumference of the circle.\n\n\n   */\n\n  \npublic\n \ndouble\n \ngetCircumference\n()\n \n{\n\n    \nreturn\n \nMath\n.\nPI\n*\n2\n*\nr\n;\n\n  \n}\n\n\n  \n/**\n\n\n   * Move the center of the circle to the new position (newX, newY)\n\n\n   */\n\n  \npublic\n \nvoid\n \nmoveTo\n(\ndouble\n \nnewX\n,\n \ndouble\n \nnewY\n)\n \n{\n\n    \nx\n \n=\n \nnewX\n;\n\n    \ny\n \n=\n \nnewY\n;\n\n  \n}\n\n\n  \n/**\n\n\n   * Return true if the given point (testX, testY) is within the circle.\n\n\n   */\n\n  \npublic\n \nboolean\n \ncontains\n(\ndouble\n \ntestX\n,\n \ndouble\n \ntestY\n)\n \n{\n\n    \nreturn\n \nfalse\n;\n\n    \n// TODO: left as an exercise  \n\n  \n}\n\n\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCreating and Interacting with \nCircle\n objects\n\n\nTo use the \nCircle\n class, we can either:\n\n\n\n\ncreate a \nmain()\n function, compile and link with the \nCircle\n class, and create an executable program, just like we usually do with a C program, OR\n\n\nuse \njshell\n, which is part of Java 9 (but not earlier versions). \njshell\n provides a \nread-evaluate-print loop\n (REPL) to help us quickly try out various features of Java.\n\n\n\n\nWe will write a complete Java program with \nmain()\n later in this class, but for now, we will use \njshell\n to demonstrate the various language features of Java\n7\n.\n\n\nThe demonstration below loads the \nCircle\n class written above (with the \ncontains\n method completed) from a file named \nCircle.java\n8\n, and creates two \nCircle\n objects, \nc1\n and \nc2\n.  We use the \nnew\n keyword to tell Java to create an object of type \nCircle\n here, passing in the center and the radius.\n\n\n1\nCircle\n \nc1\n \n=\n \nnew\n \nCircle\n(\n0\n,\n \n0\n,\n \n100\n);\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReference Type vs. Primitive Type\n\n\nThe variable \nc1\n actually stores an abstraction over a \nreference\n to the Circle object, instead of the object itself.\n\nAll objects are stored as references in Java\n.\n\n\nThe other variable type supported in Java is \nprimitive\n type.  A variable of primitive type stores the \nvalue\n instead of a reference to the value.\nJava supports eight \nprimitive\n data types: \nbyte\n, \nshort\n, \nint\n, \nlong\n, \nfloat\n, \ndouble\n, \nboolean\n and \nchar\n.  If you are familiar with C, these data types should not be foreign to you.  One important difference is that a \nchar\n variable stores a 16-bit Unicode character, not an 8-bit character like in C.  Java uses the type \nbyte\n for that.  The other notable difference is that Java defines \ntrue\n and \nfalse\n as possible value to a \nboolean\n, unlike C which uses \n0\n for false and non-\n0\n for true.  \n\n\nYou can read all about Java \nvariables\n and \nprimitive data types\n in Oracle's Java Tutorial.\n\n\nType Safety\n\n\nSome languages are stricter in terms of type \"compatibility\" than others.  C compilers, however, are not very strict.  If it detects something strange with the type you used, it will issue a warning, but still let your code compiles and runs.\n\n\nTake:\n\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n#include\n \n<stdio.h>\n\n\nint\n \nmain\n()\n\n\n{\n\n    \nprintf\n(\n\"%d\n\\n\n\"\n,\n \n\"cs2030\"\n);\n\n\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn Line 4, we treat the address to a string as integer.

A programming language is a formal language that helps programmers specify precisely what are the instructions we issue to computers, using code that are often made up of keywords, symbols, and names.  Computers execute the instructions in their  processing units , and store the instructions and data in their  memory 1 .  The processing units recognize the instructions based on the specific patterns of bits and manipulate data as a sequence of bits.  A programming language, however, is written at a higher level of  abstraction  (i.e., at a higher conceptual level), so that as a programmer, we only need to write a few lines of code to give complex instructions to the computer.  A  compiler  or  interpreter  is responsible for translating these programs written in high level language to  assembly code  or  machine code , i.e., bit patterns that the processing units can understand.  There are thousands of programming languages in existence.   C  is one of the languages that is a  low-level language  -- i.e., it provides a very thin layer of abstractions on top of machine code.  On the other hand, languages such as  Python  and  JavaScript  are high-level languages.  As an example, in C, you can directly manage memory allocation.  In JavaScript and Python, you cannot.",

But we should not be referring to the memory location all the time.  First, referring to something like  0xFA49130E  is not user-friendly; Second, the location may change.  A  variable  is an abstraction that allows us to give a user-friendly name to a piece of data in memory.  We use the  variable name  whenever we want to access the  value  in that location, and  pointer to the variable  or  reference to the variable  whenever we want to refer to the address of the location.  Let's think a bit more about how a sequence of bits is abstracted as data in a programming language.  At the machine level, these bits are just, well, bits.  We give the bits a  semantic  at the program level, e.g., we want to interpret the sequence of bits as numbers, letters, etc.  E.g., the number (integer, to be exact)  65  and the letter  A  all share the same sequence of bits  0100 0001  but are interpreted differently and possibly manipulated differently.    The  type  of a variable tells the compiler or the interpreter how to interpret the variable and how to manipulate the variable.    For instance, supposed that in Python, if you have two variables  x  and  y  storing the values  4  and  5  respectively, if you  print x + y , you would get  45  if  x  and  y  are strings; you would get  9  if  x  and  y  are integers; you would get an error if  4  is an integer and  5  is a string.    In the last instance above, you see that assigning a type to each variable helps to keep the program meaningful, as the operation  +  is not defined over an integer and a string in Python 2 .  Python is a  dynamically typed  language.  The same variable can hold values of different types, and checking if the right type is used is done during the execution of the program.  Note that, the type is associated with the  values , and the type of the variable changes depending on the value it holds.  C, on the other hand, is a  statically typed  language.  We need to  declare  every variable we use in the program and specify its type.  A variable can only hold values of the same type as the type of the variable, so we can't assign, for instance, a string to a variable of type  int .  We check if the right type is used during the compilation of the program.  1\n2 int   x   =   4 ;   // ok  int   y   =   \"5\" ;   // error    By annotating each variable with its type, the C compiler also knows how much memory space is needed to store a variable.",

This abstraction allows programmers to group a set of instructions and give it a name.  The named set of instructions may take one or more variables as input parameters, and return one or more values.     Like all other abstractions, defining functions allow us to think at a higher conceptual level.  By composing functions at increasingly higher level of abstractions, we can build programs with increasing level of complexity.  Defining functions allow us to abstract away the implementation details from the caller.  Once a function is defined, we can change the way the function is implemented without affecting the code that calls the function, as long as the semantic and the  interface  of the function remains the same.  Function, therefore, is a critical mechanism for achieving  separation of concerns  in a program.  We separate the concerns about how a particular function is implemented, from the concerns about how the function is used to perform a higher-level task.  Defining functions also allow us to  reuse  code.  We do not have to repeatedly write the same chunk of code if we group the sequence of code into a function -- then we just need to call the function to invoke this sequence of code every time we need it.  If this chunk of code is properly written and debugged, then we can be pretty sure that everywhere the function is invoked, the code is correct 3 .  C is a  procedural language .  A C program consists of functions, with the  main()  function serves as the entry point to the program.  Since C is a statically typed language, a C function has a return type, and each  function parameter (or  argument ) has a type as well.  (Note that this statement does not mean that a C function must return a  value .  If the function does not return a value, we define its return type as  void .)  Recall that the bits representing the instructions are also stored in the computer memory in an area separated from the data.  The instructions that belong to the same function are stored in adjacent memory locations.  Just like we can refer to a variable using its memory address through its  reference  (or  pointer ), we can refer to a function using the memory address of the entry point to the function.",

This is another powerful abstraction in programming languages that help us to think at a higher conceptual level without worrying about the details.   Commonly used examples are mathematical objects such as complex numbers, 2D data points, multi-dimensional vectors, circles, etc, or every day objects such as a person, a product, etc.  Defining composite data type allows programmers to abstract away (and be separated from the concern of) how a complex data type is represented.  For instance, a circle on a 2D plane can be represented by the center ( x ,  y ) and its radius  r , or it can be represented by the top left corner ( x , y ) and the width  w  of the bounding square.  In C, we build composite data type with  struct .  For example,  1\n2\n3\n4 struct   circle   { \n   float   x ,   y ;   // (x,y) coordinate of the center. \n   float   r ;   // radius  }    Once we have the  struct  defined, we are not completely shielded from its representation, until we write a set of functions that operates on the  circle  composite type.  For instance,  1\n2\n3 float   circle_area ( circle   c )   {   ...   };  bool    circle_contains_point ( circle   c ,   point   p )   {   ...   }; \n   :    Implementing these functions obviously requires the knowledge of how a circle is represented.  Once the set of functions that operates on and manipulates circles is available, we can use  circle  type without worrying about the internal representation.    If we decide to change the representation of a circle, then only the set of functions that operates on a circle type need to be changed, but not the code that uses circles to do other things.  We can imagine an  abstraction barrier  between the code that uses a composite data type along with its associated set of functions, and the code that define the data type along with the implementation of the functions.  Above the barrier, the concern is about using the composite data type to do useful things, while below the barrier, the concern is about how to represent and manipulate the composite data type.  While many of you are used to writing a program solo, in practice, you rarely write a program with contributions from a single person.  The abstraction barrier separates the role of the programmer into two: (i) an  implementer , which define that data type and provide the implementation, and (ii) a  client , which uses the composite data type to perform a higher level task 4 .  Part of my aim in CS2030 is to switch your mindset into thinking in terms of these two roles.  Note that the implementer and the client may very well be the same programmer.",

A class is a data type with a group of functions associated with it.  We call the functions as  methods  and the data in the class as  fields  (or  members , or  states , or  attributes 4 ).   A well-designed class maintains the abstraction barrier, properly wraps the barrier around the internal representation and implementation, and exposes just the right  interface  for others to use.  Just like we can create variables of a given type, we can create  objects  of a given class.  Objects are  instances  of a class, each allowing the same methods to be called, and each containing the same set of variables of the same types, but (possibly) storing different values.  Recall that programs written in a procedural language such as a C consists of functions, with a  main()  function as the entry point.  A program written in an  object-oriented language  such as Java consists of classes, with one main class as the entry point.  One can view a running object-oriented (or OO) program as something that instantiates objects of different classes and orchestrates their interactions with each other by calling each others' methods.  One could argue that an object-oriented way of writing programs is much more natural, as it mirrors our world more closely.  If we look around us, we see objects all around us, and each object has certain properties, exhibit certain behavior, and they allow certain actions.  We interact with the objects through their interfaces, and we rarely need to know the internals of the objects we used everyday (unless we try to repair it) 5 .

Breaking Python's Abstraction Barrier  Python tries to prevent  accidental  access to internal representation by having a convention of prefixing the internal variables with  _  (one underscore) or  __  (two underscores).

            "text": "With data hiding, we completely isolate the internal representation of a class using an abstraction barrier.  With no way for the user of the class to modify the fields directly, it is common for a class to provide methods to initialize and modify these internal fields (such as the  moveTo()  method above).  A method that initializes an object is called a  constructor , and a method that retrieves or modifies the properties of the object is called the  accessor  (or  getter ) or  mutator  (or  setter ).  A constructor method is a special method within the class.  It cannot be called directly but is invoked automatically when an object is instantiated.   In Java, a constructor method  has the same name as the class  and  has no return type .  A constructor can take in arguments just like other functions.  The class  Circle  can have a constructor such as the following:   1\n 2\n 3\n 4\n 5\n 6\n 7\n 8\n 9\n10\n11\n12 class   Circle   { \n     : \n   /**     * Create a circle centered on (centerX, centerY) with given radius    */ \n   public   Circle ( double   centerX ,   double   centerY ,   double   radius )   { \n     x   =   centerX ; \n     y   =   centerY ; \n     r   =   radius ; \n   } \n     :  }    The use of accessor and mutator methods is a bit controversial.   Suppose that we provide an accessor method and a mutator method for every private field, then we are actually exposing the internal representation, therefore breaking the encapsulation.  For instance:   1\n 2\n 3\n 4\n 5\n 6\n 7\n 8\n 9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28 class   Circle   { \n     : \n\n   public   double   getX ()   { \n     return   x ; \n   } \n\n   public   void   setX ( double   newX )   { \n     x   =   newX ; \n   } \n\n   public   double   getY ()   { \n     return   y ; \n   } \n\n   public   void   setY ( double   newY )   { \n     y   =   newY : \n   } \n\n   public   double   getR ()   { \n     return   r ; \n   } \n\n   public   void   setR ( double   newR )   { \n     r   =   newR ; \n   } \n     :  }    The examples above are pretty pointless.  If we need to know the internal and do something with it, we are doing it wrong.  The right approach is to implement a method within the class that do whatever we want the class to do.   For instance, suppose that we want to know the circumference of the circle  c , one approach would be:  1     double   circumference   =   2 * c . getR ()* 3.1415926 ;    where  c  is a  Circle  object.  A better approach would be to add a new method  getCircumference()  in the  Circle  class, and call it instead: 1     double   circumference   =   c . getCircumference ();    The better approach involves writing a few more lines of code to implement the method, but it keeps the encapsulation intact.  If one fine day, the implementer of  Circle  decided to store the diameter of the circle instead of the radius, then only the implementer needs to change the implementation of  getCircumference .  The client does not have to change anything.     Constructor in Python and JavaScript  In Python, the constructor is the  __init__  method.

The constant  \\(\\pi\\)  is universal, and does not really belong to any object (the value of  \\(\\pi\\)  is the same for every circle!).  Another example: if we define a method  sqrt()  that computes the square root of a given number, this is a general function that is not associated with any object as well.  A solution to this is to associate these  global  values and functions with a  class  instead of with an  object .  For instance. Java predefines a  Math  class 6  that is populated with constants  PI  and  E  (for Euler's number  \\(e\\) ), along with a long list of mathematical functions.  To associate a method or a field with a class in Java, we declare them with the  static  keyword.  We can additionally add a keyword  final  to indicate that the value of the field will not change 7 .  1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6 class   Math   { \n   : \n   public   static   final   double   PI   =   3.141592653589793 ; \n   : \n   :  }    We call these fields and methods that are associated with a class as  class fields  and  class methods , and fields and methods that are associated with an object as  instance fields  and  instance methods .   Class Fields and Methods in Python  Note that, in Python, any variable declared within a  class  block is a class field: 1\n2\n3 class   Circle : \n   x   =   0 \n   y   =   0   \nIn the above example,  x  and  y  are class fields, not instance fields.",

            "text": "Lecture 2: Inheritance & Polymorphism\n\n\nLearning Objectives\n\n\nAfter this lecture, students should:\n\n\n\n\nbe able to build a mental model for how objects and classes are represented in Java\n\n\nunderstand the concepts of object-oriented programming, including interface, polymorphism, late binding, inheritance, method overloading, and the usage of these concepts in programming.\n\n\nknow the purpose and usage of Java keywords \nimplements\n, \nextends\n, \nsuper\n, \nthis\n, and \n@Override\n\n\nunderstand Java concepts of arrays, enhanced \nfor\n loop, and method signature.\n\n\n\n\nMemory Model for Objects\n\n\nTo help understand how classes and objects work, it is useful to visualize how they are stored in the memory.  We mentioned last week that data (e.g., fields) and code (e.g., methods) are stored in two different regions in the memory.  Since an object contains both fields and methods, where do we keep an object?\n\n\nIt turned out that different implementations of Java may store the objects differently, but here is one way that we will follow for CS2030:\n\n\n\n\nIn the figure above, there are two objects of the same class.  An object is referred to through its reference, which is a pointer to the memory location where the instance fields for the object is stored, along with a pointer to a \nmethod table\n.  A method table stores a table of pointers to the methods, along with a table to the class fields.    \n\n\nAs an example, consider the following class:\n\n\n 1\n 2\n 3\n 4\n 5\n 6\n 7\n 8\n 9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\nclass\n \nA\n \n{\n\n  \nprivate\n \nint\n \nx\n;\n\n  \nstatic\n \npublic\n \nint\n \ny\n;\n\n\n  \npublic\n \nvoid\n \nfoo\n()\n \n{\n\n    \n:\n\n  \n}\n\n\n  \npublic\n \nvoid\n \nbar\n()\n \n{\n\n    \n:\n\n  \n}\n\n\n    \n:\n\n\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf we have two instances of A, \na1\n and \na2\n, with \nA.y = 1\n, \na1.x = 9\n, \na2.x = 40\n, then the memory layout looks like:\n\n\n\n\nNote that, we have only one copy of the \nstatic\n class field \ny\n, regardless of how many instances of \nA\n we create.\n\n\nEnforcing Abstraction Barrier with Interface\n\n\nRecall the concept of encapsulation. When we develop a large piece of software, it is important to hide the details on data representation and implementation, and only expose certain \npublic\n methods for the users to use.  We can imagine that there is an abstraction barrier between the code that implements the internals of a class (called the \nimplementer\n) and the code that uses the class (called the \nclient\n) to achieve a higher level task.\n\n\nWe have seen that we use \nprivate\n to enforce data hiding -- to hide certain fields and methods from outside of the barrier.  Now, we are going to see how we can enforce that the right set of methods are defined, implemented, and used on both sides of the barrier.\n\n\nThe mechanism to do this is through defining an \ninterface\n (aka a \nprotocol\n as it is called in Objective-C or Swift).  An interface is like a contract between the implementer of a class and the client of a class.  If a class promises to implement an interface, then we are guaranteed that the methods defined in the interface are already implemented in the class.  Otherwise, the code would not compile.\n\n\nIn Java, we can define an interface using \ninterface\n keyword:\n\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\ninterface\n \nShape\n \n{\n\n  \npublic\n \ndouble\n \ngetArea\n();\n\n  \npublic\n \ndouble\n \ngetPerimeter\n();\n\n  \npublic\n \nboolean\n \ncontains\n(\nPoint\n \np\n);\n\n\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe example interface \nShape\n above contains only the declaration of the methods, not the implementation.  \n\n\nNow, let's see how the implementer would implement a class using the interface.\n\n\n 1\n 2\n 3\n 4\n 5\n 6\n 7\n 8\n 9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\nimport\n \njava.lang.Math\n;\n\n\n\nclass\n \nCircle\n \nimplements\n \nShape\n \n{\n\n  \nprivate\n \nPoint\n \ncenter\n;\n\n  \nprivate\n \ndouble\n \nradius\n;\n\n\n  \npublic\n \nCircle\n(\nPoint\n \ncenter\n,\n \ndouble\n \nradius\n)\n \n{\n\n    \nthis\n.\ncenter\n \n=\n \ncenter\n;\n\n    \nthis\n.\nradius\n \n=\n \nradius\n;\n\n  \n}\n\n\n  \npublic\n \nvoid\n \nmoveTo\n(\nPoint\n \np\n)\n \n{\n\n    \ncenter\n \n=\n \np\n;\n\n  \n}\n\n\n  \n@Override\n\n  \npublic\n \ndouble\n \ngetArea\n()\n \n{\n\n    \nreturn\n \nMath\n.\nPI\n \n*\n \nradius\n \n*\n \nradius\n;\n\n  \n}\n\n\n  \n@Override\n\n  \npublic\n \nboolean\n \ncontains\n(\nPoint\n \np\n)\n \n{\n\n    \nreturn\n \n(\np\n.\ndistance\n(\ncenter\n)\n \n<\n \nradius\n);\n\n  \n}\n\n\n  \n@Override\n\n  \npublic\n \ndouble\n \ngetPerimeter\n()\n \n{\n\n    \nreturn\n \nMath\n.\nPI\n \n*\n \n2\n \n*\n \nradius\n;\n\n  \n}\n\n\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is very similar to the code you saw in Lecture 1, except that in Line 2, we say \nclass\n \nCircle\n \nimplements\n \nShape\n.  This line informs the compiler that the programmer intends to implement all the methods included in the interface \nShape\n exactly as declared (in terms of names, the number of arguments, the types of arguments, returned type, and access modifier).  The rest of the class is the same, except that we renamed \ngetCircumference\n with \ngetPerimeter\n, which is more general and applies to all shapes.  We also added \nannotations\n to our code by adding the line \n@Override\n before methods in \nCircle\n that implement the methods declared in \nShape\n.  This annotation is optional, but it informs the compiler of our intention and helps make the intention of the programmer clearer to others who read the code.\n\n\n\n\nJava Annotation\n\n\nAnnotations are metadata that is not part of the code.  They do not affect execution.  They are useful to compilers and other software tools, as well as humans who read the code.  While we can similarly make the code more human-friendly with comments, an annotation is structured and so can be easily parsed by software.  You will see 1-2 more useful annotations in this module.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nthis\n\n\nThe \nthis\n keyword in Java that refers to the current object.  In the example above, we use \nthis\n to disambiguate the argument \ncenter\n and the field \ncenter\n.  In general, it is a good practice to use \nthis\n when referring the instance variable of the current object to make your intention clear.\n\n\n\n\nNote that we can have other methods (such as \nmoveTo\n) in the class beyond what is promised in the interface the class implements.\n\n\nA class can implement more than one interface.\n  For instance, let's say that we have another interface called \nPrintable\n[^1] with a single method defined:\n\n\n1\n2\n3\ninterface\n \nPrintable\n \n{\n\n  \npublic\n \nvoid\n \nprint\n();\n\n\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe implementer of \nCircle\n wants to inform the clients that the method \nvoid print()\n is implemented, it can do the following:\n\n\n 1\n 2\n 3\n 4\n 5\n 6\n 7\n 8\n 9\n10\nclass\n \nCircle\n \nimplements\n \nShape\n,\n \nPrintable\n \n{\n\n     \n:\n\n     \n:\n\n   \n@Override\n\n   \npublic\n \nvoid\n \nprint\n()\n \n{\n\n     \nSystem\n.\nout\n.\nprintf\n(\n\"radius: %f\\n\"\n,\n \nradius\n);\n\n     \nSystem\n.\nout\n.\nprintf\n(\n\"center:\"\n);\n\n     \ncenter\n.\nprint\n();\n\n   \n}\n\n\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the above, we call \nprint()\n on the \nPoint\n object as well.  How do we know that \nPoint\n provides a \nprint()\n method?  Well, we can read the implementation code of \nPoint\n, or we can agree with the implementer of \nPoint\n that \nPoint\n provides a \nPrintable\n interface!  \n\n\nIt is important to note that, \ninterface\n provides a \nsyntactic\n contract on the abstraction barrier, but it does not provide a \nsemantic\n contract.  It does not, for instance, guarantee that \nprint()\n actually prints something to the screen.  One could still implement interface \nPrintable\n as follows:\n\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\nclass\n \nCircle\n \nimplements\n \nShape\n,\n \nPrintable\n \n{\n\n     \n:\n\n     \n:\n\n   \n@Override\n\n   \npublic\n \nvoid\n \nprint\n()\n \n{\n\n   \n}\n\n\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nand the code still compiles!\n\n\nNot all programming languages that support classes support interface.  C++, Javascript, and Python, for instance, do not support similar concepts.\n\n\n\n\nDefault Access Modifier for Interface\n\n\nIn the examples above, I explicitly specify the methods in the \nPrintable\n and \nShape\n interfaces as \npublic\n.  In Java, all methods in an interface are public by default, so the keywords \npublic\n could be omitted.\n\n\n\n\nInterface as Type\n\n\nIn Java, an interface is a type.  What this means is that:\n\n\n\n\nWe can declare a variable with an interface type, such as:\n\n1\n  \nShape\n \ncircle\n;\n\n\n\n\n\nor\n\n1\n  \nPrintable\n \ncircle\n;\n\n\n\n\n\nWe cannot, however, instantiate an object from an interface\nsince an interface is a \"template\", an \"abstraction\", and does not have an implementation.  For instance:\n\n\n\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n  \n// this is not OK\n\n  \nPrintable\n \np\n \n=\n \nnew\n \nPrintable\n();\n\n  \n// this is OK\n\n  \nPrintable\n \ncircle\n \n=\n \nnew\n \nCircle\n(\nnew\n \nPoint\n(\n0\n,\n \n0\n),\n \n10\n);\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSimilarly, we can pass arguments of an interface type into a method, and the return type of a method can be an interface.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAn object can be an instance of multiple types.  Recall that Java is a statically typed language. We associate a type with a variable.  We can assign a variable to an object if the object is an instance of the type of the variable.  For example, Line 4 above creates a new circle, which is an instance of three types: \nCircle\n, \nShape\n, and \nPrintable\n.  It is ok to assign this new circle to a variable of type \nPrintable\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe say that \nShape\n and \nPrintable\n are \nsupertypes\n of \nCircle\n, and \nCircle\n is a subtype of \nShape\n and \nPrintable\n.\n\n\nLate Binding and Polymorphism\n\n\nWe can now do something cool like this:\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n  \nPrintable\n[]\n \nobjs\n;\n\n    \n:\n\n    \n// initialize array objs\n\n  \n:\n\n  \nfor\n \n(\nPrintable\n \no\n:\n \nobjs\n)\n \n{\n\n      \no\n.\nprint\n();\n\n  \n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLet's examine this code.  Line 1 declares an array of objects of type \nPrintable\n.  We skip over the code to initialize the content of the array for now, and\njump to Line 5-7, which is a \nfor\n loop.  Line 5 declares a loop variable \no\n of type \nPrintable\n and loops through all objects in the array \nobjs\n, and Line 6 invokes the method \nprint\n of \no\n.\n\n\n\n\nArray and For Loops in Java\n\n\nSee Oracle's tutorial on \narray\n and \nenhanced loop\n\n\n\n\nThe magic happens in Line 6:\n\n\n\n\nFirst, since we know that any object in the array has the type \nPrintable\n, this means that they must implement the \nPrintable\n interface and support the method \nprint()\n.  \n\n\nSecond, we do not know, and we do not \nneed\n to know which class an object is an instance of.\n\n\nThird, we can actually have objects of completely unrelated classes in the same array. We can have objects of type \nCircle\n, and objects of type \nPoint\n.  We can have objects of type \nFactory\n, or objects of type \nStudent\n, or objects of type \nCushion\n.  As long as the objects implement the \nPrintable\n interface, we can put them into the same array.\n\n\nFourth, at \nrun time\n, Java looks at the object \no\n, and determines its class, and invokes the right implementation of \nprint()\n corresponding to the \no\n.  That is, if \no\n is an instance of a class \nCircle\n, then it will call \nprint()\n method of \nCircle\n; if \no\n is an instance of a class \nPoint\n, then it will call \nprint()\n method of \nPoint\n, and so on.\n\n\n\n\nTo further appreciate the magic in Line 6, especially on last point above, consider how a function call is done in C.  In C, you cannot have two functions of the same name within the same scope, so if you call a function \nprint()\n, you know exactly which set of instructions will be called\n1\n.  So, the name \nprint\n is bound to the corresponding set of instructions at compilation time.  This is called \nstatic binding\n or \nearly binding\n.\nTo have \nprint()\n for different types, we need to name them differently to avoid naming conflicts: e.g., \nprint_point()\n, \nprint_circle()\n.\n\n\nIn a language with static binding, suppose you want to mix objects of different types\ntogether in an array, you need to do something like the following pseudocode:\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n   \nfor\n \neach\n \nobject\n \nin\n \nthe\n \narray\n\n       \nif\n \nobject\n \nis\n \na\n \npoint\n\n           \nprint_point\n(\nobject\n)\n\n       \nelse\n \nif\n \nobject\n \nis\n \na\n \ncircle\n\n           \nprint_circle\n(\nobject\n)\n\n     \nelse\n \nif\n \nobject\n \nis\n \na\n \nsquare\n\n           \nprint_square\n(\nobject\n)\n\n           \n:\n\n           \n:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNot only is the code verbose and ugly, it would be cumbersome if you define a new compound data type that supports printing, since you would need to remember to add a new if-else condition to call for a corresponding print function.\n\n\nIn OO languages, you can have methods named \nprint()\n implemented differently in different classes.  When we compile the code above, the compiler will have no way to know which implementation will be called.  The bindings of \nprint()\n to the actual set of instructions will only be done at run time, after the object \no\n is instantiated from a class.  This is known as \ndynamic binding\n, or \nlate binding\n, or \ndynamic dispatch\n.\n\n\n\n\nIf you understand how an object is represented internally, this is not so magical after all.  Referring to the figure above, the array \nobjs[]\n contains an array of references to objects, the first one is a \nCircle\n object, and the following two are \nPoint\n objects.  When \no.print()\n is invoked, Java refers to the method table, which points to either the method table for \nCircle\n or for \nPoint\n, based on the class the object is an instance of.\n\n\nThis behavior, which is common to OO programming languages, is known as \npolymorphism\n2\n.\n\n\nThe Abstraction Principle\n\n\nWith the interface \nShape\n, we can implement other classes, such as \nRectangle\n, \nSquare\n, \nPolygon\n with the same interface.  For instance,\n\n\n1\n2\n3\nclass\n \nRectangle\n \nimplements\n \nShape\n,\n \nPrintable\n \n{\n\n   \n// left as exercise (See Exercise 2)\n\n\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSo far, we have been treating our shapes as pure geometric objects.  Let's consider an application where we want to paint the shapes.  Each shape should have a fill color and a border (with color and thickness).\n\n\n 1\n 2\n 3\n 4\n 5\n 6\n 7\n 8\n 9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\nimport\n \njava.awt.Color\n;\n\n    \n:\n\n\n\nclass\n \nPaintedCircle\n \nimplements\n \nShape\n,\n \nPrintable\n \n{\n\n  \nprivate\n \nColor\n  \nfillColor\n;\n\n  \nprivate\n \nColor\n  \nborderColor\n;\n\n  \nprivate\n \ndouble\n \nborderThickness\n;\n\n\n  \npublic\n \nvoid\n \nfillWith\n(\nColor\n \nc\n)\n \n{\n\n    \nfillColor\n \n=\n \nc\n;\n\n  \n}\n\n\n  \npublic\n \nvoid\n \nsetBorderThickness\n(\ndouble\n \nt\n)\n \n{\n\n    \nborderThickness\n \n=\n \nt\n;\n\n  \n}\n\n\n  \npublic\n \nvoid\n \nsetBorderColor\n(\nColor\n \nc\n)\n \n{\n\n    \nborderColor\n \n=\n \nc\n;\n\n  \n}\n\n\n  \n// other methods and fields for Circle from before\n\n\n\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the code above, we added the line \nimport\n \njava.awt.Color\n to use the \nColor class\n that Java provides, and added three private members as well as their setters.\n\n\nWe can do the same for \nTriangle\n\n\n 1\n 2\n 3\n 4\n 5\n 6\n 7\n 8\n 9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\nimport\n \njava.awt.Color\n;\n\n    \n:\n\n\n\nclass\n \nPaintedTriangle\n \nimplements\n \nShape\n,\n \nPrintable\n \n{\n\n  \nprivate\n \nColor\n  \nfillColor\n;\n\n  \nprivate\n \nColor\n  \nborderColor\n;\n\n  \nprivate\n \ndouble\n \nborderThickness\n;\n\n\n  \npublic\n \nvoid\n \nfillWith\n(\nColor\n \nc\n)\n \n{\n\n    \nfillColor\n \n=\n \nc\n;\n\n  \n}\n\n\n  \npublic\n \nvoid\n \nsetBorderThickness\n(\ndouble\n \nt\n)\n \n{\n\n    \nborderThickness\n \n=\n \nt\n;\n\n  \n}\n\n\n  \npublic\n \nvoid\n \nsetBorderColor\n(\nColor\n \nc\n)\n \n{\n\n    \nborderColor\n \n=\n \nc\n;\n\n  \n}\n\n\n  \n// other methods and fields written for Triangle\n\n\n\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nand for other shapes.\n\n\nGreat!  We now have colorful shapes.  The code above, however, is not \ngood\n code, even though it is \ncorrect\n.  Just consider what needs to be done if we decide to support border styles (dotted border, solid border, dashed border, etc).  We would have to edit every single class that supports colors and borders!\n\n\nOne principle that we can follow is the \nabstraction principle\n, which says \"Each significant piece of functionality in a program should be implemented in just one place in the source code. Where similar functions are carried out by distinct pieces of code, it is generally beneficial to combine them into one by abstracting out the varying parts.\"\n3\n\n\nFollowing the principle, we want to implement these style-related fields and methods in just one place.  But where?\n\n\nInheritance\n\n\nThe OO-way to do this is to create a \nparent class\n, and put all common fields and methods into the parent.  A parent class is defined just like a normal class.  For instance:\n\n\n 1\n 2\n 3\n 4\n 5\n 6\n 7\n 8\n 9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\nclass\n \nPaintedShape\n \n{\n\n  \nprivate\n \nColor\n  \nfillColor\n;\n\n  \nprivate\n \nColor\n  \nborderColor\n;\n\n  \nprivate\n \ndouble\n \nborderThickness\n;\n\n\n  \npublic\n \nPaintedShape\n(\nColor\n \nfillColor\n,\n \nColor\n \nborderColor\n,\n \ndouble\n \nborderThickness\n)\n \n{\n\n    \nthis\n.\nfillColor\n \n=\n \nfillColor\n;\n\n    \nthis\n.\nborderColor\n \n=\n \nborderColor\n;\n\n    \nthis\n.\nborderThickness\n \n=\n \nborderThickness\n;\n\n  \n}\n\n\n  \npublic\n \nvoid\n \nfillWith\n(\nColor\n \nc\n)\n \n{\n\n    \nfillColor\n \n=\n \nc\n;\n\n  \n}\n\n\n  \npublic\n \nvoid\n \nsetBorderThickness\n(\ndouble\n \nt\n)\n \n{\n\n    \nborderThickness\n \n=\n \nt\n;\n\n  \n}\n\n\n  \npublic\n \nvoid\n \nsetBorderColor\n(\nColor\n \nc\n)\n \n{\n\n    \nborderColor\n \n=\n \nc\n;\n\n  \n}\n\n\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe \nPaintedCircle\n class, \nPaintedSquare\n class, etc, can now \ninherits\n non-private fields and methods from the parent class, using the \nextends\n keyword.\n\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\nclass\n \nPaintedCircle\n \nextends\n \nPaintedShape\n \nimplements\n \nShape\n,\n \nPrintable\n \n{\n\n      \n:\n\n\n}\n\n\n\nclass\n \nPaintedSquare\n \nextends\n \nPaintedShape\n \nimplements\n \nShape\n,\n \nPrintable\n \n{\n\n      \n:\n\n\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis mechanism for a class to inherit the properties and behavior from a parent is called \ninheritance\n, and is the fourth and final basic OO principles we cover\n4\n.\n\n\nWith inheritance, we do not have to repeat the declaration of fields \nfillColor\n, \nborderColor\n, \nborderThickness\n and the associated methods in them.  This software engineering principle is also known as the DRY principle -- \"\ndon't repeat yourself\n\" principle.  We are going to see DRY very regularly in future lectures.\n\n\nWe also call the \nPaintedShape\n the superclass (or base class) of \nPaintedCircle\n and \nPaintedSquare\n, and call \nPaintedCircle\n and \nPaintedSquare\n the subclass (or derived class)\n5\n of \nPaintedShape\n.\n\n\nA \nPaintedCircle\n object can now call \nfillWith()\n even if the method \nfillWith()\n is not defined in \nPaintedCircle\n -- it is defined in \nPaintedCircle\n's parent \nPaintedShape\n.  \n\n\nWhen a class extends a parent class, it inherits all the non-private fields and methods, so we can depict the objects and the class as follows:\n\n\n\n\nThe method table now includes pointers to methods defined in the parent (and grandparents, and so on).\n\n\nOverloading\n\n\nNow consider the constructor for \nPaintedCircle\n.   We need to initialize the geometric shape as well as the painting style.  But, we define the fields \nfillColor\n, etc \nprivate\n, and thus subclasses have no access to \nprivate\n fields in the parent.  We need to call the constructor of the parent to initialize these private fields.  The way to do this is to use the \nsuper\n keyword, as such:\n\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n  \npublic\n \nPaintedCircle\n(\nPoint\n \ncenter\n,\n \ndouble\n \nradius\n,\n \nColor\n \nfillColor\n,\n \nColor\n \nborderColor\n,\n \ndouble\n \nborderThickness\n)\n \n{\n\n    \nsuper\n(\nfillColor\n,\n \nborderColor\n,\n \nborderThickness\n);\n\n    \nthis\n.\ncenter\n \n=\n \ncenter\n;\n\n    \nthis\n.\nradius\n \n=\n \nradius\n;\n\n  \n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can see that the constructor for \nPaintedCircle\n now takes in five parameters.  You can imagine that as the class gets more sophisticated with more fields, we need to pass in more parameters to the class to initialize the fields.  It is not uncommon to provide alternative constructors with fewer parameters and assign some \ndefault\n values to the fields.\n\n\n 1\n 2\n 3\n 4\n 5\n 6\n 7\n 8\n 9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n  \n// create circle with default style (white with black border of thickness 1)\n\n  \npublic\n \nPaintedCircle\n(\nPoint\n \ncenter\n,\n \ndouble\n \nradius\n)\n \n{\n\n    \nsuper\n(\nColor\n.\nWHITE\n,\n \nColor\n.\nBLACK\n,\n \n1.0\n);\n\n    \nthis\n.\ncenter\n \n=\n \ncenter\n;\n\n    \nthis\n.\nradius\n \n=\n \nradius\n;\n\n  \n}\n\n\n  \n// create circle with customized styles  \n\n  \npublic\n \nPaintedCircle\n(\nPoint\n \ncenter\n,\n \ndouble\n \nradius\n,\n \nColor\n \nfillColor\n,\n \nColor\n \nborderColor\n,\n \ndouble\n \nborderThickness\n)\n \n{\n\n    \nsuper\n(\nfillColor\n,\n \nborderColor\n,\n \nborderThickness\n);\n\n    \nthis\n.\ncenter\n \n=\n \ncenter\n;\n\n    \nthis\n.\nradius\n \n=\n \nradius\n;\n\n  \n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTwo methods in a class can have the same name and still co-exist peacefully together.  This is called \noverloading\n.  When a method is called, we look at the \nsignature\n of the method, which consists of (i) the name of the method, (ii) the number, order, and type of the arguments, to determine which method is called.  To be precise, the first sentence of this paragraph should read: Two methods in a class can have the same name and still co-exist peacefully together, as long as they have different signatures.  Note that the return type is not part of the method signature, so you cannot have two methods with the same name and same arguments but different return type.  \n\n\nEven though the example above shows overloading of the constructor, we can overload other methods as well.  \n\n\nExercise\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConsider what happen when we do the following:\n\n\n1\n2\n3\nCircle\n \nc\n \n=\n \nnew\n \nCircle\n(\nnew\n \nPoint\n(\n0\n,\n0\n),\n \n10\n);\n\n\nShape\n \nc1\n \n=\n \nc\n;\n\n\nPrintable\n \nc2\n \n=\n \nc\n;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAre the following statements allowed?

You should make use of the class \nPoint\n that you implemented from Lecture 1's exercise.  Then write another class \nPaintedRectangle\n that implements the two interfaces and inherits from \nPaintedShape\n that implements the two interfaces and inherits from \nPaintedShape\n.  You can assume that the sides of the rectangles are parallel with the x- and y-axes (in other words, the sides are either horizontal or vertical).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(i) Write an interface called \nShape3D\n that supports a method \ngetVolume\n.  Write a class called \nCuboid\n that implements \nShape3D\n and has three private \ndouble\n fields \nlength\n, \nheight\n, and \nbreadth\n.  \ngetVolume()\n should return the volume of the \nCuboid\n object.  The constructor for \nCuboid\n should allow the client to create a \nCuboid\n object by specifying the three fields \nlength\n, \nheight\n and \nbreadth\n.\n\n\n(ii) We can extend one interface from another as well.  Find out how, and write a new interface \nSolid3D\n that inherits from interface \nShape3D\n that supports a method \ngetDensity\n and \ngetMass\n.  \n\n\n(iii) Now, write a new class called \nSolidCuboid\n with an additional private \ndouble\n field \ndensity\n.  The implementation of \ngetDensity()\n should return this field while \ngetMass()\n should return the mass of the cuboid.  The \nSolidCuboid\n should call the constructor of \nCuboid\n via \nsuper\n and provides two constructors: one constructor allows the client to specify the density, and the other does not and just set the default density to 1.0.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWrite a class \nRectangle\n that implements \nShape\n.  A \nRectangle\n class has two \ndouble\n fields, \nlength\n and \nwidth\n, and a public method \nsetSize(int length, int width)\n that allows the client to change its size.  \n\n\nNow, write a class \nSquare\n that inherits from \nRectangle\n.  A \nSquare\n has an additional constraint that \nlength\n must be the same as \nwidth\n.  How should \nSquare\n implement the \nsetSize(int length, int width)\n method?  Do you think \nSquare\n should inherit from \nRectangle\n?  Or should it be another way around?  Or maybe they should not inherit from each other?\n\n\n(Note: to implement the \ncontains\n method in \nShape\n, you need to also keep the position of the \nSquare\n (top left corner, for instance).  But, it is not important for this question)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRemember a function is just an abstraction over a set of instructions.\u00a0\n\u21a9\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn biology, polymorphism means that an organism can have many different forms.\u00a0\n\u21a9\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis principle is formulated by Benjamin C.

We mentioned last week that data (e.g., fields) and code (e.g., methods) are stored in two different regions in the memory.  Since an object contains both fields and methods, where do we keep an object?  It turned out that different implementations of Java may store the objects differently, but here is one way that we will follow for CS2030:   In the figure above, there are two objects of the same class.  An object is referred to through its reference, which is a pointer to the memory location where the instance fields for the object is stored, along with a pointer to a  method table .  A method table stores a table of pointers to the methods, along with a table to the class fields.      As an example, consider the following class:   1\n 2\n 3\n 4\n 5\n 6\n 7\n 8\n 9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14 class   A   { \n   private   int   x ; \n   static   public   int   y ; \n\n   public   void   foo ()   { \n     : \n   } \n\n   public   void   bar ()   { \n     : \n   } \n\n     :  }    If we have two instances of A,  a1  and  a2 , with  A.y = 1 ,  a1.x = 9 ,  a2.x = 40 , then the memory layout looks like:   Note that, we have only one copy of the  static  class field  y , regardless of how many instances of  A  we create.",

            "location": "/lec02/index.html#enforcing-abstraction-barrier-with-interface",
            "text": "Recall the concept of encapsulation. When we develop a large piece of software, it is important to hide the details on data representation and implementation, and only expose certain  public  methods for the users to use.  We can imagine that there is an abstraction barrier between the code that implements the internals of a class (called the  implementer ) and the code that uses the class (called the  client ) to achieve a higher level task.  We have seen that we use  private  to enforce data hiding -- to hide certain fields and methods from outside of the barrier.  Now, we are going to see how we can enforce that the right set of methods are defined, implemented, and used on both sides of the barrier.  The mechanism to do this is through defining an  interface  (aka a  protocol  as it is called in Objective-C or Swift).  An interface is like a contract between the implementer of a class and the client of a class.  If a class promises to implement an interface, then we are guaranteed that the methods defined in the interface are already implemented in the class.  Otherwise, the code would not compile.  In Java, we can define an interface using  interface  keyword:  1\n2\n3\n4\n5 interface   Shape   { \n   public   double   getArea (); \n   public   double   getPerimeter (); \n   public   boolean   contains ( Point   p );  }    The example interface  Shape  above contains only the declaration of the methods, not the implementation.    Now, let's see how the implementer would implement a class using the interface.   1\n 2\n 3\n 4\n 5\n 6\n 7\n 8\n 9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30 import   java.lang.Math ;  class   Circle   implements   Shape   { \n   private   Point   center ; \n   private   double   radius ; \n\n   public   Circle ( Point   center ,   double   radius )   { \n     this . center   =   center ; \n     this . radius   =   radius ; \n   } \n\n   public   void   moveTo ( Point   p )   { \n     center   =   p ; \n   } \n\n   @Override \n   public   double   getArea ()   { \n     return   Math . PI   *   radius   *   radius ; \n   } \n\n   @Override \n   public   boolean   contains ( Point   p )   { \n     return   ( p . distance ( center )   <   radius ); \n   } \n\n   @Override \n   public   double   getPerimeter ()   { \n     return   Math . PI   *   2   *   radius ; \n   }  }    This is very similar to the code you saw in Lecture 1, except that in Line 2, we say  class   Circle   implements   Shape .  This line informs the compiler that the programmer intends to implement all the methods included in the interface  Shape  exactly as declared (in terms of names, the number of arguments, the types of arguments, returned type, and access modifier).  The rest of the class is the same, except that we renamed  getCircumference  with  getPerimeter , which is more general and applies to all shapes.  We also added  annotations  to our code by adding the line  @Override  before methods in  Circle  that implement the methods declared in  Shape .  This annotation is optional, but it informs the compiler of our intention and helps make the intention of the programmer clearer to others who read the code.   Java Annotation  Annotations are metadata that is not part of the code.  They do not affect execution.  They are useful to compilers and other software tools, as well as humans who read the code.  While we can similarly make the code more human-friendly with comments, an annotation is structured and so can be easily parsed by software.  You will see 1-2 more useful annotations in this module.    this  The  this  keyword in Java that refers to the current object.  In the example above, we use  this  to disambiguate the argument  center  and the field  center .  In general, it is a good practice to use  this  when referring the instance variable of the current object to make your intention clear.   Note that we can have other methods (such as  moveTo ) in the class beyond what is promised in the interface the class implements.  A class can implement more than one interface.   For instance, let's say that we have another interface called  Printable [^1] with a single method defined:  1\n2\n3 interface   Printable   { \n   public   void   print ();  }    The implementer of  Circle  wants to inform the clients that the method  void print()  is implemented, it can do the following:   1\n 2\n 3\n 4\n 5\n 6\n 7\n 8\n 9\n10 class   Circle   implements   Shape ,   Printable   { \n      : \n      : \n    @Override \n    public   void   print ()   { \n      System . out . printf ( \"radius: %f\\n\" ,   radius ); \n      System . out . printf ( \"center:\" ); \n      center . print (); \n    }  }    In the above, we call  print()  on the  Point  object as well.  How do we know that  Point  provides a  print()  method?  Well, we can read the implementation code of  Point , or we can agree with the implementer of  Point  that  Point  provides a  Printable  interface!    It is important to note that,  interface  provides a  syntactic  contract on the abstraction barrier, but it does not provide a  semantic  contract.  It does not, for instance, guarantee that  print()  actually prints something to the screen.  One could still implement interface  Printable  as follows:  1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7 class   Circle   implements   Shape ,   Printable   { \n      : \n      : \n    @Override \n    public   void   print ()   { \n    }  }    and the code still compiles!  Not all programming languages that support classes support interface.  C++, Javascript, and Python, for instance, do not support similar concepts.   Default Access Modifier for Interface  In the examples above, I explicitly specify the methods in the  Printable  and  Shape  interfaces as  public .  In Java, all methods in an interface are public by default, so the keywords  public  could be omitted.",

            "text": "In Java, an interface is a type.  What this means is that:   We can declare a variable with an interface type, such as: 1    Shape   circle ;   \nor 1    Printable   circle ;   \nWe cannot, however, instantiate an object from an interface\nsince an interface is a \"template\", an \"abstraction\", and does not have an implementation.  For instance:   1\n2\n3\n4    // this is not OK \n   Printable   p   =   new   Printable (); \n   // this is OK \n   Printable   circle   =   new   Circle ( new   Point ( 0 ,   0 ),   10 );      Similarly, we can pass arguments of an interface type into a method, and the return type of a method can be an interface.    An object can be an instance of multiple types.  Recall that Java is a statically typed language. We associate a type with a variable.  We can assign a variable to an object if the object is an instance of the type of the variable.  For example, Line 4 above creates a new circle, which is an instance of three types:  Circle ,  Shape , and  Printable .  It is ok to assign this new circle to a variable of type  Printable .    We say that  Shape  and  Printable  are  supertypes  of  Circle , and  Circle  is a subtype of  Shape  and  Printable .",

            "text": "We can now do something cool like this: 1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7    Printable []   objs ; \n     : \n     // initialize array objs \n   : \n   for   ( Printable   o :   objs )   { \n       o . print (); \n   }    Let's examine this code.  Line 1 declares an array of objects of type  Printable .  We skip over the code to initialize the content of the array for now, and\njump to Line 5-7, which is a  for  loop.  Line 5 declares a loop variable  o  of type  Printable  and loops through all objects in the array  objs , and Line 6 invokes the method  print  of  o .   Array and For Loops in Java  See Oracle's tutorial on  array  and  enhanced loop   The magic happens in Line 6:   First, since we know that any object in the array has the type  Printable , this means that they must implement the  Printable  interface and support the method  print() .    Second, we do not know, and we do not  need  to know which class an object is an instance of.  Third, we can actually have objects of completely unrelated classes in the same array. We can have objects of type  Circle , and objects of type  Point .  We can have objects of type  Factory , or objects of type  Student , or objects of type  Cushion .  As long as the objects implement the  Printable  interface, we can put them into the same array.  Fourth, at  run time , Java looks at the object  o , and determines its class, and invokes the right implementation of  print()  corresponding to the  o .  That is, if  o  is an instance of a class  Circle , then it will call  print()  method of  Circle ; if  o  is an instance of a class  Point , then it will call  print()  method of  Point , and so on.   To further appreciate the magic in Line 6, especially on last point above, consider how a function call is done in C.  In C, you cannot have two functions of the same name within the same scope, so if you call a function  print() , you know exactly which set of instructions will be called 1 .  So, the name  print  is bound to the corresponding set of instructions at compilation time.  This is called  static binding  or  early binding .\nTo have  print()  for different types, we need to name them differently to avoid naming conflicts: e.g.,  print_point() ,  print_circle() .  In a language with static binding, suppose you want to mix objects of different types\ntogether in an array, you need to do something like the following pseudocode: 1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9     for   each   object   in   the   array \n        if   object   is   a   point \n            print_point ( object ) \n        else   if   object   is   a   circle \n            print_circle ( object ) \n      else   if   object   is   a   square \n            print_square ( object ) \n            : \n            :    Not only is the code verbose and ugly, it would be cumbersome if you define a new compound data type that supports printing, since you would need to remember to add a new if-else condition to call for a corresponding print function.  In OO languages, you can have methods named  print()  implemented differently in different classes.  When we compile the code above, the compiler will have no way to know which implementation will be called.  The bindings of  print()  to the actual set of instructions will only be done at run time, after the object  o  is instantiated from a class.  This is known as  dynamic binding , or  late binding , or  dynamic dispatch .   If you understand how an object is represented internally, this is not so magical after all.  Referring to the figure above, the array  objs[]  contains an array of references to objects, the first one is a  Circle  object, and the following two are  Point  objects.  When  o.print()  is invoked, Java refers to the method table, which points to either the method table for  Circle  or for  Point , based on the class the object is an instance of.  This behavior, which is common to OO programming languages, is known as  polymorphism 2 .",

Great!  We now have colorful shapes.  The code above, however, is not  good  code, even though it is  correct .

One principle that we can follow is the  abstraction principle , which says \"Each significant piece of functionality in a program should be implemented in just one place in the source code. Where similar functions are carried out by distinct pieces of code, it is generally beneficial to combine them into one by abstracting out the varying parts.\" 3  Following the principle, we want to implement these style-related fields and methods in just one place.

With inheritance, we do not have to repeat the declaration of fields  fillColor ,  borderColor ,  borderThickness  and the associated methods in them.  This software engineering principle is also known as the DRY principle -- \" don't repeat yourself \" principle.  We are going to see DRY very regularly in future lectures.  We also call the  PaintedShape  the superclass (or base class) of  PaintedCircle  and  PaintedSquare , and call  PaintedCircle  and  PaintedSquare  the subclass (or derived class) 5  of  PaintedShape .  A  PaintedCircle  object can now call  fillWith()  even if the method  fillWith()  is not defined in  PaintedCircle  -- it is defined in  PaintedCircle 's parent  PaintedShape .    When a class extends a parent class, it inherits all the non-private fields and methods, so we can depict the objects and the class as follows:   The method table now includes pointers to methods defined in the parent (and grandparents, and so on).",

But, we define the fields  fillColor , etc  private , and thus subclasses have no access to  private  fields in the parent.

The way to do this is to use the  super  keyword, as such:  1\n2\n3\n4\n5    public   PaintedCircle ( Point   center ,   double   radius ,   Color   fillColor ,   Color   borderColor ,   double   borderThickness )   { \n     super ( fillColor ,   borderColor ,   borderThickness ); \n     this . center   =   center ; \n     this . radius   =   radius ; \n   }    You can see that the constructor for  PaintedCircle  now takes in five parameters.

The \nObject\n class defines many useful methods that are common to all objects.  The two useful ones are :\n\n\n\n\nequals(Object obj)\n, which checks if two objects are equal to each other, and\n\n\ntoString()\n, which returns a string representation of the object, and is a better way to print an object than the \nprint()\n method and \nPrintable\n interface we write.\n\n\n\n\nThe \nequals()\n method as implemented in \nObject\n, only compares if two object references refer to the same object.  In the Figure below, we show an array \ncircles\n with three \nCircle\n objects.  All three circles are centered at (0, 0) with radius 10.  They are created as follows:\n\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n    \nCircle\n[]\n \ncircles\n \n=\n \nnew\n \nCircle\n[\n3\n];\n\n    \ncircles\n[\n0\n]\n \n=\n \nnew\n \nCircle\n(\nnew\n \nPoint\n(\n0\n,\n \n0\n),\n \n10\n);\n\n    \ncircles\n[\n1\n]\n \n=\n \nnew\n \nCircle\n(\nnew\n \nPoint\n(\n0\n,\n \n0\n),\n \n10\n);\n\n    \ncircles\n[\n2\n]\n \n=\n \ncircles\n[\n1\n];\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen you check \ncircles[0].equals(circles[1])\n, however, it returns \nfalse\n, because even though \ncircles[0]\n and \ncircles[1]\n are semantically the same, they refer to the two different objects.  Calling \ncircles[1].equals(circles[2])\n returns \ntrue\n, as they are referring to the same object.  \n\n\n\n\nWhat if you need a method that compares if two circles are \nsemantically\n the same?  You can implement your own method, say \nisTheSameCircle(Circle c)\n.  But, the \nequals()\n method is universal (all classes inherits this method) and is used by other classes for equality tests.  So, in most cases, we can implement a method called \nequals()\n with the same signature with the semantic that we want[^8].\n\n\nThat's right.  Even though we cannot have two methods with the same signature in the same class, we can have two methods with the same signature, one in the superclass (or the superclass's superclass, and so on), one in the subclass.  The method in the subclass will override the method in the superclass.  For example,\n\n\n 1\n 2\n 3\n 4\n 5\n 6\n 7\n 8\n 9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\nclass\n \nCircle\n \nimplements\n \nShape\n,\n \nPrintable\n \n{\n\n    \n:\n\n  \n@Override\n\n  \npublic\n \nboolean\n \nequals\n(\nObject\n \nobj\n)\n \n{\n\n    \nif\n \n(\nthis\n \n==\n \nobj\n)\n \n{\n\n      \nreturn\n \ntrue\n;\n\n    \n}\n\n    \nif\n \n(\nobj\n \ninstanceof\n \nCircle\n)\n \n{\n\n      \nCircle\n \ncircle\n \n=\n \n(\nCircle\n)\n \nobj\n;\n\n      \nreturn\n \n(\ncircle\n.\ncenter\n.\nequals\n(\ncenter\n)\n \n&&\n \ncircle\n.\nradius\n \n==\n \nradius\n);\n\n    \n}\n \nelse\n \n{\n\n      \nreturn\n \nfalse\n;\n\n    \n}\n\n  \n}\n\n\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLine 10 above compares if the two center points are equal, and the two radius values are equal.  So, we compare if the two circles are semantically the same.  The rest of this code requires some explanation:\n\n\n\n\nLine 3 uses the same \n@Override\n annotation that we have seen before -- we are telling the compilers that we are overriding a method in the superclass.\n\n\nLine 4 declares the method \nequals\n, and note that it has to have exactly the same signature as the \nequals()\n method we are overriding.  Even though we meant to compare two \nCircle\n objects, we cannot declare it as \npublic boolean equals(Circle circle)\n, since the signature is different and the compiler would complain.\n\n\nSince \nobj\n is of an \nObject\n type, we can actually pass in any object to compare with a \nCircle\n.  Line 5 checks if the comparison makes sense, by checking if \nobj\n is instantiated from a \nCircle\n class, using the \ninstanceof\n keyword.  If \nobj\n is not even a \nCircle\n object, then we simply return \nfalse\n.\n\n\nIf \nobj\n is an instance of \nCircle\n, we assign \nobj\n to a variable of type \nCircle\n and compare as in Line 10.\n\n\n\n\nFor the code above to work, we have to override the \nequals\n method of \nPoint\n as well.  That is left as an exercise\n1\n.\n\n\nOne final note: polymorphism works here as well.  If we have an object reference \nobj\n of type \nObject\n that refers to an instance of a \nCircle\n, calling \nobj.equals()\n will invoke the \nequals()\n method of \nCircle\n, not \nObject\n, just like the case of interfaces.\n\n\nRecall that when a class implements an interface, an instance of that class can take on the type of that interface.  Similarly, when a class inherits from a parent class, an instance of that class can take on the type of the parent class.  So, we can do the following:\n\n\n1\n2\nCircle\n \nc\n \n=\n \nnew\n \nCircle\n(\nnew\n \nPoint\n(\n0\n,\n0\n),\n \n10\n);\n\n\nObject\n \no\n \n=\n \nc\n;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLine 2 assigns the circle object \nc\n to \no\n of type \nObject\n.  So, both \no\n and \nc\n are referring to the same objects.  Due to type checking at compile time, however, Java does not allow methods and fields in the subclass (e.g., \nCircle\n) that is not in the superclass (e.g., \nObject\n) to be called.  In this example, only the methods known to \nObject\n can be accessed by \no\n.\n\n\nNow, consider what would happen if we override the method \nequals()\n from the \nObject\n class.  \n\n\nThe method table will update the entry for \nequals()\n to point to the implementation provided by the \nCircle\n class, instead of the \nObject\n class.\n\n\n\n\nNow, consider what would happen if we \noverload\n the method \nequals()\n with one that takes in a \nCircle\n object.  I also throw in a couple of \nSystem.out.print()\n to help us figure out what is going on.\n\n\n 1\n 2\n 3\n 4\n 5\n 6\n 7\n 8\n 9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\nclass\n \nCircle\n \nimplements\n \nShape\n,\n \nPrintable\n \n{\n\n    \n:\n\n  \n@Override\n\n  \npublic\n \nboolean\n \nequals\n(\nObject\n \nobj\n)\n \n{\n\n    \nSystem\n.\nout\n.\nprintln\n(\n\"equals(Object) called\"\n);\n\n    \nif\n \n(\nobj\n \n==\n \nthis\n)\n \n{\n\n      \nreturn\n \ntrue\n;\n\n    \n}\n\n    \nif\n \n(\nobj\n \ninstanceof\n \nCircle\n)\n \n{\n\n      \nCircle\n \ncircle\n \n=\n \n(\nCircle\n)\n \nobj\n;\n\n      \nreturn\n \n(\ncircle\n.\ncenter\n.\nequals\n(\ncenter\n)\n \n&&\n \ncircle\n.\nradius\n \n==\n \nradius\n);\n\n    \n}\n \nelse\n \n{\n\n      \nreturn\n \nfalse\n;\n\n    \n}\n\n  \n}\n\n\n  \npublic\n \nboolean\n \nequals\n(\nCircle\n \ncircle\n)\n \n{\n\n    \nSystem\n.\nout\n.\nprintln\n(\n\"equals(Circle) called\"\n);\n\n    \nreturn\n \n((\ncircle\n.\ncenter\n.\nequals\n(\ncenter\n)\n \n&&\n \ncircle\n.\nradius\n \n==\n \nradius\n);\n\n  \n}\n \n\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSince this new \nequals()\n method does not override the method in \nObject\n, it gets its own slot in the method table of \nCircle\n, instead of reusing one from the \nObject\n.\n\n\n\n\nNow, consider which version of \nequals\n are called by the following:\n\n\n 1\n 2\n 3\n 4\n 5\n 6\n 7\n 8\n 9\n10\n11\nCircle\n \nc1\n \n=\n \nnew\n \nCircle\n(\nnew\n \nPoint\n(\n0\n,\n0\n),\n \n10\n);\n\n\nCircle\n \nc2\n \n=\n \nnew\n \nCircle\n(\nnew\n \nPoint\n(\n0\n,\n0\n),\n \n10\n);\n\n\nObject\n \no1\n \n=\n \nc1\n;\n\n\nObject\n \no2\n \n=\n \nc2\n;\n\n\n\no1\n.\nequals\n(\no2\n);\n\n\no1\n.\nequals\n((\nCircle\n)\no2\n);\n\n\no1\n.\nequals\n(\nc2\n);\n\n\nc1\n.\nequals\n(\no2\n);\n\n\nc1\n.\nequals\n((\nCircle\n)\no2\n);\n\n\nc1\n.\nequals\n(\nc2\n);\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLines 6-9 call \nequals(Object)\n defined in \nCircle\n\uff0c while Lines 10-11 call \nequals(Circle)\n defined in \nCircle\n.  Let's look at why for each one:\n\n\n\n\nLine 6 calls \nequals\n of an \nObject\n object on an \nObject\n object.  Java checks through all methods defined in \nObject\n, and finds a method that matches the signature, which is the \nequals(Object)\n (which \nCircle\n has overridden). This is the one that will get called.\n\n\nLine 7-8 call \nequals\n of an \nObject\n object on a \nCircle\n object.  Java checks through all methods defined in \nObject\n and finds one method that matches the signature, which is \nequals(Object)\n (which \nCircle\n has overridden).  Even though there is another method \nequals(Circle)\n defined, it is defined as part of the \nCircle\n class, which Java refuses to access because \no1\n is declared to have the type \nObject\n.  Since the only method that Java can find has an argument of type \nObject\n, the argument is cast as an \nObject\n when \nequals\n is invoked.\n\n\nLine 9 calls \nequals\n of a \nCircle\n object on an \nObject\n object.  Java finds a method with the matching signature, \nequals(Object)\n, and invokes that.\n\n\nFinally, Lines 10-11 call \nequals\n of a \nCircle\n object on a \nCircle\n object.  Even though there are two overloaded methods which Java can call without type error, Java always invokes \nthe most specific method\n, in this case, \nequals(Circle)\n.\n\n\n\n\nWhy do we need to override \nequals\n in \nObject\n, rather than just using the \nCircle\n-specific \nequals(Circle)\n?  As shown above, only when an object declared as \nCircle\n calls \nequals\n on another \nCircle\n object, the \nCircle\n-specific \nequals(Circle)\n is invoked.\n\nTo write code that is general and reusable, we should exploit OO polymorphism, that means different subclasses of \nObject\n implement their own customized version of \nequals\n, and the right version of \nequals\n will be called.\n\n\nOne example of where this is called the \ncontains(Object)\n method from class \nArrayList\n (we will cover this later in class), which checks if an object is already in the list, and to check this, it checks for equality of the given object with every object in the \nArrayList\n, by calling \nequals(Object)\n.\n\n\ntoString\n\n\nWe now turn our attention to another method in \nObject\n that we could override, the \ntoString()\n method.  \ntoString()\n is called whenever the \nString\n representation of an object is needed.  For instance, when we try to print an object.   By default, the \ntoString\n of \nObject\n simply prints the name of the class, followed by \n@\n, followed by the reference.   It is often useful to override this to include the content of the object as well, for debugging and logging purposes.  This is a much more useful and flexible way than writing our own \nprint()\n method as we have seen in earlier lectures, since we are not limited to printing to standard output anymore.\n\n\n\n\njava.lang.String\n\n\nString\n is one of the many useful classes provided by Java.  You can skim through to see what methods are available and keep the \nAPI reference\n handy.\n\n\n\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\nclass\n \nPoint\n \n{\n\n  \n:\n\n  \npublic\n \nString\n \ntoString\n()\n \n{\n\n    \nreturn\n \n\"(\"\n \n+\n \nx\n \n+\n \n\",\"\n \n+\n \ny\n \n\")\"\n;\n\n  \n}\n\n\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow, if we run:\n\n1\n2\nPoint\n \np\n \n=\n \nnew\n \nPoint\n(\n0\n,\n0\n);\n\n\nSystem\n.\nout\n.\nprintln\n(\np\n);\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt should print \n(0,0)\n instead of \nPoint\n@1235\nde\n.\n\n\nThe ability to override methods that you inherit from a parent, including root class \nObject\n, makes overriding an extremely powerful tool.  It allows you to change how existing libraries behave, and customize them to your classes, without changing a single line of their code or even accessing their code!\n\n\nAs Uncle Ben said, \"With great power, comes great responsibility.\"  We must use overriding and inheritance carefully.  Since we can affect how existing libraries behave, we can easily break existing code and introduce bugs.  Since you may not have access to these existing code, it is often tricky to trace and debug.  \n\n\n\n\nUsing \nsuper\n To Access Overridden Methods\n\n\nAfter a subclass overrides a method in the superclass, the methods have been overridden can still be called, with \nsuper\n keyword. \nFor instance, the following \ntoString\n implementation of \nPoint\n calls the \ntoString\n from \nObject\n, to prefix the string representation of Point with the class and reference address.\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n@Override\n\n\npublic\n \nString\n \ntoString\n()\n \n{\n\n  \nreturn\n \nsuper\n.\ntoString\n()\n \n+\n \n\" (\"\n \n+\n \nx\n \n+\n \n\",\"\n \n+\n \ny\n \n+\n \n\")\"\n;\n\n\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe \nprotected\n and Default Access Modifiers\n\n\nIn the last lecture, when we inherit \nCircle\n from \nPaintedShape\n, we set the fields \nfillColor\n etc to \nprivate\n, to create an abstraction barrier between the superclass and its subclasses.  This barrier allows the implementor of the superclass to freely change the internal representation of the superclass without worrying about the effect on the subclasses.\n\n\nSometimes, the implementor of a superclass may choose to allow the subclasses to have access to some of its fields and methods, but yet prevent other classes from accessing them.  This type of access restriction can be achieved with the \nprotected\n access modifier. \n\n\n\n\nprotected\n in Other Languages\n\n\nC++ and C# both provide \nprotected\n keyword, allowing subclasses to access \nprotected\n fields and methods of the superclass.  Swift, however, decided that \ndeciding fields/methods access based on inheritance complicates things without bringing any advantage\n and does not provide the \nprotected\n access modifier.\n\n\n\n\nJava Packages\n\n\nSo far we have written several classes and interfaces (\nCircle\n, \nPoint\n, \nShape\n, \nPrintable\n, \nPaintedShape\n, \nSquare\n, etc).  We are using common names to name our classes and interfaces, and it is not inconceivable that in a large software project using external libraries that we will end up with multiple classes with the same name!  For instance, Java library provides a \nPoint\n class and a \nShape\n interface as well.  \n\n\nJava \npackage\n mechanism allows us to group relevant classes and interfaces together under a \nnamespace\n.  You have seen two packages so far: \njava.awt\n where we import the \nColor\n class from, and \njava.lang\n where we import the \nMath\n class from.  These are provided by Java as standard libraries.  We can also create our own package and put the classes and interfaces into the same package.  We (and the clients) can then import and use the classes and interfaces that we provide.  \n\n\nBesides providing namespace to disambiguate classes or interfaces with the same name, Java \npackage\n also provides another higher-layer of abstraction barrier.  In Java, a \nprotected\n field or method can be accessed by other classes in the same package.\n\n\nFinally, Java has the forth access modifier known as the default modifier.  This access modifier (or lack of it) is used when we do not specify \npublic\n, \nprotected\n, nor \nprivate\n.  A field or member with no access modifier is private to the package -- it is \npublic\n to all classes within the same package, but \nprivate\n to classes outside of the package.  The default access modifier is also known as \npackage-private\n by some.\n\n\nThe following table, taken from \nOracle's Java Tutorial\n\nsummarizes the access modifiers:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAccess Modifier\n\n\nClass\n\n\nPackage\n\n\nSubclass\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\npublic\n\n\nY\n\n\nY\n\n\nY\n\n\nY\n\n\n\n\n\n\nprotected\n\n\nY\n\n\nY\n\n\nY\n\n\nN\n\n\n\n\n\n\nno modifier\n\n\nY\n\n\nY\n\n\nN\n\n\nN\n\n\n\n\n\n\nprivate\n\n\nY\n\n\nN\n\n\nN\n\n\nN\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn Java, every class belongs to a package, whether we like it or not.  If we do not declare that a class belongs to a package, then it belongs to the default package.\n\n\nWe will not be discussing \npackage\n much more than what we have done today.  You can learn more about packages via \nOracle's Java Tutorial\n.\n\n\nModeling HAS-A Relationship\n\n\nInheritance in OO tends to get overused.  \nIn practice, we seldom use inheritance\n.  Let's look at some examples of how \nnot\n to use inheritance, and why.\n\n\nYou may come across examples online or in books that look like the following:\n\n\n 1\n 2\n 3\n 4\n 5\n 6\n 7\n 8\n 9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\nclass\n \nPoint\n \n{\n\n  \nprotected\n \ndouble\n \nx\n;\n\n  \nprotected\n \ndouble\n \ny\n;\n\n    \n:\n\n\n}\n\n\n\nclass\n \nCircle\n \nextends\n \nPoint\n \n{\n\n  \nprotected\n \ndouble\n \nradius\n;\n\n    \n:\n\n\n}\n\n\n\nclass\n \nCylinder\n \nextends\n \nCircle\n \n{\n\n  \nprotected\n \ndouble\n \nheight\n;\n\n    \n:\n\n\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCircle\n implemented like the above would have the center coordinate inherited from the parent (so it has three fields, x, y, and radius), and \nCylinder\n would have the fields corresponding to a circle, which is its base, and the height.  So, we are \nreusing\n the fields and the code related to initializing and manipulating the fields.\n\n\nWhen we start to consider methods encapsulated with each object, things start to get less intuitive.  What does \ngetPerimeter()\n and \ngetArea()\n of \nCylinder\n means?  How about \ndistanceTo\n between a \nCylinder\n and a \nPoint\n?   What is the meaning of a \nCircle\n containing a \nCylinder\n?\n\n\nThe inheritance hierarchy above actually models the HAS-A relationship: A circle has a center (which is a point), a cylinder has a base which is a circle.  Therefore, a better way to capture the relationship between the three types of objects is through \ncomposition\n:\n\n\n 1\n 2\n 3\n 4\n 5\n 6\n 7\n 8\n 9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\nclass\n \nPoint\n \n{\n\n  \ndouble\n \nx\n;\n\n  \ndouble\n \ny\n;\n\n    \n:\n\n\n}\n\n\n\nclass\n \nCircle\n \n{\n\n  \nPoint\n \ncenter\n;\n\n  \ndouble\n \nradius\n;\n\n    \n:\n\n\n}\n\n\n\nclass\n \nCylinder\n \n{\n\n  \nCircle\n \nbase\n;\n\n  \ndouble\n \nheight\n;\n\n    \n:\n\n\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComposition allows us to build more complex classes from simpler ones, and is usually favored over inheritance.  \n\n\nThe \nPaintedShape\n class from Lecture 2, for instance, could be modeled as a composition of a \nStyle\n object and \nShape\n object.\n\n\n 1\n 2\n 3\n 4\n 5\n 6\n 7\n 8\n 9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\nclass\n \nStyle\n \n{\n\n  \nColor\n \nfillColor\n;\n\n  \nColor\n \nborderColor\n;\n\n    \n:\n\n\n}\n\n\n\nclass\n \nPaintedShape\n \n{\n\n  \nStyle\n \nstyle\n;\n\n  \nShape\n \nshape\n;\n\n    \n:\n\n  \npublic\n \ndouble\n \ngetArea\n()\n \n{\n\n    \nreturn\n \nshape\n.\ngetArea\n();\n\n  \n}\n\n  \n:\n\n  \npublic\n \nvoid\n \nfillWith\n(\nColor\n \nc\n)\n \n{\n\n    \nstyle\n.\nfillWith\n(\nc\n);\n\n  \n}\n\n    \n:\n\n\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe design above is also known as the \nforwarding\n -- calls to methods on \nPaintedShape\n gets forwarded to either \nStyle\n or \nShape\n objects.\n\n\nModeling IS-A Relationship\n\n\nA better situation to use inheritance is to model a IS-A relationship: when the subclass behaves just like parent class, but has some additional behaviors.  For instance, it is natural to model a \nPaintedCircle\n as a subclass of \nCircle\n -- since a PaintedCircle has all the behavior of \nCircle\n, but has \nadditional\n behaviors related to being painted.\n\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\nclass\n \nPaintedCircle\n \nextends\n \nCircle\n \n{\n\n  \nStyle\n \nstyle\n;\n\n    \n:\n\n\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA more tricky situation for modeling a IS-A relationship occurs when the subclass behaves just like the parent class \nmost\n of the time, but sometimes behave slightly differently than the parent.  Consider how we model a rectangle and a square.  Normally, we consider a square IS-A special case of a rectangle.  So, we could model as:\n\n\n 1\n 2\n 3\n 4\n 5\n 6\n 7\n 8\n 9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\nclass\n \nRectangle\n \n{\n\n  \ndouble\n \nwidth\n,\n \nheight\n;\n\n  \nPoint\n \ntopLeft\n;\n\n  \nRectangle\n(\nPoint\n \ntopLeft\n,\n \nin\n \nwidth\n,\n \nint\n \nheight\n)\n \n{\n\n    \nthis\n.\ntopLeft\n \n=\n \ntopLeft\n;\n\n    \nthis\n.\nwidth\n \n=\n \nwidth\n;\n\n    \nthis\n.\nheight\n \n=\n \nheight\n;\n\n  \n}\n\n\n}\n\n\n\nclass\n \nSquare\n \nextends\n \nRectangle\n \n{\n\n  \nSquare\n(\nPoint\n \ntopLeft\n,\n \nint\n \nwidth\n)\n \n{\n\n      \nsuper\n(\ntopLeft\n,\n \nwidth\n,\n \nwidth\n);\n\n  \n}\n\n\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSo far, so good.\n\n\nNow, suppose the two classes are written by two different developers.  The developer who wrote Rectangle decided to add the method \nresizeTo\n:\n\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\nclass\n \nRectangle\n \n{\n\n      \n:\n\n    \nvoid\n \nsetSize\n(\nint\n \nwidth\n,\n \nint\n \nheight\n)\n \n{\n\n        \nthis\n.\nwidth\n \n=\n \nwidth\n;\n\n        \nthis\n.\nheight\n \n=\n \nheight\n;\n\n    \n}\n\n\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis developer assumes the behavior that, after calling \nsetSize(w, h)\n, the width of the rectangle will be \nw\n and the height will be \nh\n.  He/she publishes this API, and another developer then assumes this behavior, and wrote some code, like:\n\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\nvoid\n \ndoSomething\n(\nRectangle\n \nr\n)\n \n{\n\n  \nr\n.\nsetSize\n(\n1\n,\n \n2\n);\n\n    \n:\n\n\n}\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat should the developer who develops \nSquare\n do?  Since \nSquare\n is a subclass of \nRectangle\n, it would inherit \nsetSize\n from its parent, but it does not make sense to call \nsetSize\n with two different parameters.  Sure, \nSquare\n can overload \nsetSize\n and provide a \nsetSize\n with one parameter only, but that does not prevent someone from calling \nsetSize\n with two parameters on a \nSquare\n.  Someone could do the following and the code would still compile and run, turning the square into a rectangle!\n\n\n1\n2\nSquare\n \ns\n \n=\n \nnew\n \nSquare\n(\nnew\n \nPoint\n(\n0\n,\n0\n),\n \n10\n);\n\n\ns\n.\nsetSize\n(\n4\n,\n \n8\n);\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe \nSquare\n developer can try to override \nsetSize\n, to ignore the second parameter:\n\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\nclass\n \nSquare\n \n{\n\n    \n:\n\n  \nvoid\n \nsetSize\n(\nint\n \nwidth\n,\n \nint\n \nheight\n)\n \n{\n\n    \nthis\n.\nwidth\n \n=\n \nwidth\n;\n\n    \nthis\n.\nheight\n \n=\n \nwidth\n;\n\n  \n}\n\n\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis makes more sense and would make everyone who uses \nSquare\n happy -- a square is always a square -- but it introduces an \ninconsistency\n in behavior and will most likely break another part of the code that the developer is totally unaware of.  The developer of \ndoSomething\n suddenly cannot assume that \nsetSize\n works as intended and documented.\n\n\nIt is a developer's responsibility that any inheritance with method overriding does not alter the behavior of existing code.  This brings us to the \nLiskov Substitution Principle\n (LSP), which says that: \"Let \n\\(\\phi(x)\\)\n be a property provable about objects \n\\(x\\)\n of type \n\\(T\\)\n. Then \n\\(\\phi(y)\\)\n should be true for objects \n\\(y\\)\n of type \n\\(S\\)\n where \n\\(S\\)\n is a subtype of \n\\(T\\)\n.\"   \n\n\nThis means that if \n\\(S\\)\n is a subclass of \n\\(T\\)\n, then an object of type \n\\(T\\)\n can be replaced by an object of type \n\\(S\\)\n without changing the desirable property of the program.\n\n\nIn the example above, this means that everywhere we can expect rectangles to be used, we can replace a rectangle with a square.  This was no longer true with the introduction of \nsetSize\n method.\n\n\nPreventing Inheritance and Method Overriding\n\n\nSometimes, it is useful for a developer to explicitly prevent a class to be inherited.  Not allowing inheritance would make it much easier to argue for the correctness of programs, something that is important when it comes to writing secure programs.  Both the two java classes you have seen, \njava.lang.Math\n and \njava.lang.String\n, cannot be inherited from.  In Java, we use the keyword \nfinal\n when declaring a class to tell Java that we ban this class from being inherited.\n\n\n1\n2\n3\nfinal\n \nclass\n \nCircle\n \n{\n\n    \n:\n\n\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlternatively, we can allow inheritance, but still prevent a specific method from being overridden, by declaring a method as \nfinal\n.  Usually, we do this on methods that are critical for the correctness of the class.\n\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\nclass\n \nCircle\n \n{\n\n   \n:\n\n  \nfinal\n \npublic\n \nboolean\n \ncontains\n(\nPoint\n \np\n)\n \n{\n\n    \n:\n\n  \n}\n\n\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nfinal variable\n\n\nThe keyword \nfinal\n has another use.   When declaring a variable as \nfinal\n, just like\n    \nPI\n in \nMath\n, it prevents the variable from being modified.

            "text": "In Java, every class inherits from the  class  Object  implicitly.  The  Object  class defines many useful methods that are common to all objects.  The two useful ones are :   equals(Object obj) , which checks if two objects are equal to each other, and  toString() , which returns a string representation of the object, and is a better way to print an object than the  print()  method and  Printable  interface we write.   The  equals()  method as implemented in  Object , only compares if two object references refer to the same object.  In the Figure below, we show an array  circles  with three  Circle  objects.  All three circles are centered at (0, 0) with radius 10.  They are created as follows:  1\n2\n3\n4      Circle []   circles   =   new   Circle [ 3 ]; \n     circles [ 0 ]   =   new   Circle ( new   Point ( 0 ,   0 ),   10 ); \n     circles [ 1 ]   =   new   Circle ( new   Point ( 0 ,   0 ),   10 ); \n     circles [ 2 ]   =   circles [ 1 ];    When you check  circles[0].equals(circles[1]) , however, it returns  false , because even though  circles[0]  and  circles[1]  are semantically the same, they refer to the two different objects.  Calling  circles[1].equals(circles[2])  returns  true , as they are referring to the same object.     What if you need a method that compares if two circles are  semantically  the same?  You can implement your own method, say  isTheSameCircle(Circle c) .  But, the  equals()  method is universal (all classes inherits this method) and is used by other classes for equality tests.  So, in most cases, we can implement a method called  equals()  with the same signature with the semantic that we want[^8].  That's right.  Even though we cannot have two methods with the same signature in the same class, we can have two methods with the same signature, one in the superclass (or the superclass's superclass, and so on), one in the subclass.  The method in the subclass will override the method in the superclass.  For example,   1\n 2\n 3\n 4\n 5\n 6\n 7\n 8\n 9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15 class   Circle   implements   Shape ,   Printable   { \n     : \n   @Override \n   public   boolean   equals ( Object   obj )   { \n     if   ( this   ==   obj )   { \n       return   true ; \n     } \n     if   ( obj   instanceof   Circle )   { \n       Circle   circle   =   ( Circle )   obj ; \n       return   ( circle . center . equals ( center )   &&   circle . radius   ==   radius ); \n     }   else   { \n       return   false ; \n     } \n   }  }    Line 10 above compares if the two center points are equal, and the two radius values are equal.  So, we compare if the two circles are semantically the same.  The rest of this code requires some explanation:   Line 3 uses the same  @Override  annotation that we have seen before -- we are telling the compilers that we are overriding a method in the superclass.  Line 4 declares the method  equals , and note that it has to have exactly the same signature as the  equals()  method we are overriding.  Even though we meant to compare two  Circle  objects, we cannot declare it as  public boolean equals(Circle circle) , since the signature is different and the compiler would complain.  Since  obj  is of an  Object  type, we can actually pass in any object to compare with a  Circle .  Line 5 checks if the comparison makes sense, by checking if  obj  is instantiated from a  Circle  class, using the  instanceof  keyword.  If  obj  is not even a  Circle  object, then we simply return  false .  If  obj  is an instance of  Circle , we assign  obj  to a variable of type  Circle  and compare as in Line 10.   For the code above to work, we have to override the  equals  method of  Point  as well.  That is left as an exercise 1 .  One final note: polymorphism works here as well.  If we have an object reference  obj  of type  Object  that refers to an instance of a  Circle , calling  obj.equals()  will invoke the  equals()  method of  Circle , not  Object , just like the case of interfaces.  Recall that when a class implements an interface, an instance of that class can take on the type of that interface.  Similarly, when a class inherits from a parent class, an instance of that class can take on the type of the parent class.  So, we can do the following:  1\n2 Circle   c   =   new   Circle ( new   Point ( 0 , 0 ),   10 );  Object   o   =   c ;    Line 2 assigns the circle object  c  to  o  of type  Object .  So, both  o  and  c  are referring to the same objects.  Due to type checking at compile time, however, Java does not allow methods and fields in the subclass (e.g.,  Circle ) that is not in the superclass (e.g.,  Object ) to be called.  In this example, only the methods known to  Object  can be accessed by  o .  Now, consider what would happen if we override the method  equals()  from the  Object  class.    The method table will update the entry for  equals()  to point to the implementation provided by the  Circle  class, instead of the  Object  class.   Now, consider what would happen if we  overload  the method  equals()  with one that takes in a  Circle  object.  I also throw in a couple of  System.out.print()  to help us figure out what is going on.   1\n 2\n 3\n 4\n 5\n 6\n 7\n 8\n 9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21 class   Circle   implements   Shape ,   Printable   { \n     : \n   @Override \n   public   boolean   equals ( Object   obj )   { \n     System . out . println ( \"equals(Object) called\" ); \n     if   ( obj   ==   this )   { \n       return   true ; \n     } \n     if   ( obj   instanceof   Circle )   { \n       Circle   circle   =   ( Circle )   obj ; \n       return   ( circle . center . equals ( center )   &&   circle . radius   ==   radius ); \n     }   else   { \n       return   false ; \n     } \n   } \n\n   public   boolean   equals ( Circle   circle )   { \n     System . out . println ( \"equals(Circle) called\" ); \n     return   (( circle . center . equals ( center )   &&   circle . radius   ==   radius ); \n   }   }    Since this new  equals()  method does not override the method in  Object , it gets its own slot in the method table of  Circle , instead of reusing one from the  Object .   Now, consider which version of  equals  are called by the following:   1\n 2\n 3\n 4\n 5\n 6\n 7\n 8\n 9\n10\n11 Circle   c1   =   new   Circle ( new   Point ( 0 , 0 ),   10 );  Circle   c2   =   new   Circle ( new   Point ( 0 , 0 ),   10 );  Object   o1   =   c1 ;  Object   o2   =   c2 ;  o1 . equals ( o2 );  o1 . equals (( Circle ) o2 );  o1 . equals ( c2 );  c1 . equals ( o2 );  c1 . equals (( Circle ) o2 );  c1 . equals ( c2 );    Lines 6-9 call  equals(Object)  defined in  Circle \uff0c while Lines 10-11 call  equals(Circle)  defined in  Circle .  Let's look at why for each one:   Line 6 calls  equals  of an  Object  object on an  Object  object.  Java checks through all methods defined in  Object , and finds a method that matches the signature, which is the  equals(Object)  (which  Circle  has overridden). This is the one that will get called.  Line 7-8 call  equals  of an  Object  object on a  Circle  object.  Java checks through all methods defined in  Object  and finds one method that matches the signature, which is  equals(Object)  (which  Circle  has overridden).  Even though there is another method  equals(Circle)  defined, it is defined as part of the  Circle  class, which Java refuses to access because  o1  is declared to have the type  Object .  Since the only method that Java can find has an argument of type  Object , the argument is cast as an  Object  when  equals  is invoked.  Line 9 calls  equals  of a  Circle  object on an  Object  object.  Java finds a method with the matching signature,  equals(Object) , and invokes that.  Finally, Lines 10-11 call  equals  of a  Circle  object on a  Circle  object.  Even though there are two overloaded methods which Java can call without type error, Java always invokes  the most specific method , in this case,  equals(Circle) .   Why do we need to override  equals  in  Object , rather than just using the  Circle -specific  equals(Circle) ?  As shown above, only when an object declared as  Circle  calls  equals  on another  Circle  object, the  Circle -specific  equals(Circle)  is invoked. \nTo write code that is general and reusable, we should exploit OO polymorphism, that means different subclasses of  Object  implement their own customized version of  equals , and the right version of  equals  will be called.  One example of where this is called the  contains(Object)  method from class  ArrayList  (we will cover this later in class), which checks if an object is already in the list, and to check this, it checks for equality of the given object with every object in the  ArrayList , by calling  equals(Object) .",

            "text": "We now turn our attention to another method in  Object  that we could override, the  toString()  method.   toString()  is called whenever the  String  representation of an object is needed.  For instance, when we try to print an object.   By default, the  toString  of  Object  simply prints the name of the class, followed by  @ , followed by the reference.   It is often useful to override this to include the content of the object as well, for debugging and logging purposes.  This is a much more useful and flexible way than writing our own  print()  method as we have seen in earlier lectures, since we are not limited to printing to standard output anymore.   java.lang.String  String  is one of the many useful classes provided by Java.  You can skim through to see what methods are available and keep the  API reference  handy.   1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6 class   Point   { \n   : \n   public   String   toString ()   { \n     return   \"(\"   +   x   +   \",\"   +   y   \")\" ; \n   }  }    Now, if we run: 1\n2 Point   p   =   new   Point ( 0 , 0 );  System . out . println ( p );    It should print  (0,0)  instead of  Point @1235 de .  The ability to override methods that you inherit from a parent, including root class  Object , makes overriding an extremely powerful tool.  It allows you to change how existing libraries behave, and customize them to your classes, without changing a single line of their code or even accessing their code!  As Uncle Ben said, \"With great power, comes great responsibility.\"  We must use overriding and inheritance carefully.  Since we can affect how existing libraries behave, we can easily break existing code and introduce bugs.  Since you may not have access to these existing code, it is often tricky to trace and debug.     Using  super  To Access Overridden Methods  After a subclass overrides a method in the superclass, the methods have been overridden can still be called, with  super  keyword. \nFor instance, the following  toString  implementation of  Point  calls the  toString  from  Object , to prefix the string representation of Point with the class and reference address. 1\n2\n3\n4 @Override  public   String   toString ()   { \n   return   super . toString ()   +   \" (\"   +   x   +   \",\"   +   y   +   \")\" ;  }",

This barrier allows the implementor of the superclass to freely change the internal representation of the superclass without worrying about the effect on the subclasses.  Sometimes, the implementor of a superclass may choose to allow the subclasses to have access to some of its fields and methods, but yet prevent other classes from accessing them.  This type of access restriction can be achieved with the  protected  access modifier.    protected  in Other Languages  C++ and C# both provide  protected  keyword, allowing subclasses to access  protected  fields and methods of the superclass.  Swift, however, decided that  deciding fields/methods access based on inheritance complicates things without bringing any advantage  and does not provide the  protected  access modifier.",

We are using common names to name our classes and interfaces, and it is not inconceivable that in a large software project using external libraries that we will end up with multiple classes with the same name!  For instance, Java library provides a  Point  class and a  Shape  interface as well.    Java  package  mechanism allows us to group relevant classes and interfaces together under a  namespace .  You have seen two packages so far:  java.awt  where we import the  Color  class from, and  java.lang  where we import the  Math  class from.  These are provided by Java as standard libraries.  We can also create our own package and put the classes and interfaces into the same package.  We (and the clients) can then import and use the classes and interfaces that we provide.    Besides providing namespace to disambiguate classes or interfaces with the same name, Java  package  also provides another higher-layer of abstraction barrier.  In Java, a  protected  field or method can be accessed by other classes in the same package.  Finally, Java has the forth access modifier known as the default modifier.  This access modifier (or lack of it) is used when we do not specify  public ,  protected , nor  private .  A field or member with no access modifier is private to the package -- it is  public  to all classes within the same package, but  private  to classes outside of the package.  The default access modifier is also known as  package-private  by some.  The following table, taken from  Oracle's Java Tutorial \nsummarizes the access modifiers:     Access Modifier  Class  Package  Subclass  World      public  Y  Y  Y  Y    protected  Y  Y  Y  N    no modifier  Y  Y  N  N    private  Y  N  N  N     In Java, every class belongs to a package, whether we like it or not.  If we do not declare that a class belongs to a package, then it belongs to the default package.  We will not be discussing  package  much more than what we have done today.

            "text": "Inheritance in OO tends to get overused.   In practice, we seldom use inheritance .  Let's look at some examples of how  not  to use inheritance, and why.  You may come across examples online or in books that look like the following:   1\n 2\n 3\n 4\n 5\n 6\n 7\n 8\n 9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15 class   Point   { \n   protected   double   x ; \n   protected   double   y ; \n     :  }  class   Circle   extends   Point   { \n   protected   double   radius ; \n     :  }  class   Cylinder   extends   Circle   { \n   protected   double   height ; \n     :  }    Circle  implemented like the above would have the center coordinate inherited from the parent (so it has three fields, x, y, and radius), and  Cylinder  would have the fields corresponding to a circle, which is its base, and the height.  So, we are  reusing  the fields and the code related to initializing and manipulating the fields.  When we start to consider methods encapsulated with each object, things start to get less intuitive.  What does  getPerimeter()  and  getArea()  of  Cylinder  means?  How about  distanceTo  between a  Cylinder  and a  Point ?   What is the meaning of a  Circle  containing a  Cylinder ?  The inheritance hierarchy above actually models the HAS-A relationship: A circle has a center (which is a point), a cylinder has a base which is a circle.  Therefore, a better way to capture the relationship between the three types of objects is through  composition :   1\n 2\n 3\n 4\n 5\n 6\n 7\n 8\n 9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17 class   Point   { \n   double   x ; \n   double   y ; \n     :  }  class   Circle   { \n   Point   center ; \n   double   radius ; \n     :  }  class   Cylinder   { \n   Circle   base ; \n   double   height ; \n     :  }    Composition allows us to build more complex classes from simpler ones, and is usually favored over inheritance.    The  PaintedShape  class from Lecture 2, for instance, could be modeled as a composition of a  Style  object and  Shape  object.   1\n 2\n 3\n 4\n 5\n 6\n 7\n 8\n 9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19 class   Style   { \n   Color   fillColor ; \n   Color   borderColor ; \n     :  }  class   PaintedShape   { \n   Style   style ; \n   Shape   shape ; \n     : \n   public   double   getArea ()   { \n     return   shape . getArea (); \n   } \n   : \n   public   void   fillWith ( Color   c )   { \n     style . fillWith ( c ); \n   } \n     :  }    The design above is also known as the  forwarding  -- calls to methods on  PaintedShape  gets forwarded to either  Style  or  Shape  objects.",

            "text": "A better situation to use inheritance is to model a IS-A relationship: when the subclass behaves just like parent class, but has some additional behaviors.  For instance, it is natural to model a  PaintedCircle  as a subclass of  Circle  -- since a PaintedCircle has all the behavior of  Circle , but has  additional  behaviors related to being painted.  1\n2\n3\n4 class   PaintedCircle   extends   Circle   { \n   Style   style ; \n     :  }    A more tricky situation for modeling a IS-A relationship occurs when the subclass behaves just like the parent class  most  of the time, but sometimes behave slightly differently than the parent.  Consider how we model a rectangle and a square.  Normally, we consider a square IS-A special case of a rectangle.  So, we could model as:   1\n 2\n 3\n 4\n 5\n 6\n 7\n 8\n 9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15 class   Rectangle   { \n   double   width ,   height ; \n   Point   topLeft ; \n   Rectangle ( Point   topLeft ,   in   width ,   int   height )   { \n     this . topLeft   =   topLeft ; \n     this . width   =   width ; \n     this . height   =   height ; \n   }  }  class   Square   extends   Rectangle   { \n   Square ( Point   topLeft ,   int   width )   { \n       super ( topLeft ,   width ,   width ); \n   }  }    So far, so good.  Now, suppose the two classes are written by two different developers.  The developer who wrote Rectangle decided to add the method  resizeTo :  1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7 class   Rectangle   { \n       : \n     void   setSize ( int   width ,   int   height )   { \n         this . width   =   width ; \n         this . height   =   height ; \n     }  }    This developer assumes the behavior that, after calling  setSize(w, h) , the width of the rectangle will be  w  and the height will be  h .  He/she publishes this API, and another developer then assumes this behavior, and wrote some code, like:  1\n2\n3\n4 void   doSomething ( Rectangle   r )   { \n   r . setSize ( 1 ,   2 ); \n     :  }   \nWhat should the developer who develops  Square  do?  Since  Square  is a subclass of  Rectangle , it would inherit  setSize  from its parent, but it does not make sense to call  setSize  with two different parameters.  Sure,  Square  can overload  setSize  and provide a  setSize  with one parameter only, but that does not prevent someone from calling  setSize  with two parameters on a  Square .  Someone could do the following and the code would still compile and run, turning the square into a rectangle!  1\n2 Square   s   =   new   Square ( new   Point ( 0 , 0 ),   10 );  s . setSize ( 4 ,   8 );    The  Square  developer can try to override  setSize , to ignore the second parameter:  1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7 class   Square   { \n     : \n   void   setSize ( int   width ,   int   height )   { \n     this . width   =   width ; \n     this . height   =   width ; \n   }  }    This makes more sense and would make everyone who uses  Square  happy -- a square is always a square -- but it introduces an  inconsistency  in behavior and will most likely break another part of the code that the developer is totally unaware of.  The developer of  doSomething  suddenly cannot assume that  setSize  works as intended and documented.  It is a developer's responsibility that any inheritance with method overriding does not alter the behavior of existing code.  This brings us to the  Liskov Substitution Principle  (LSP), which says that: \"Let  \\(\\phi(x)\\)  be a property provable about objects  \\(x\\)  of type  \\(T\\) . Then  \\(\\phi(y)\\)  should be true for objects  \\(y\\)  of type  \\(S\\)  where  \\(S\\)  is a subtype of  \\(T\\) .\"     This means that if  \\(S\\)  is a subclass of  \\(T\\) , then an object of type  \\(T\\)  can be replaced by an object of type  \\(S\\)  without changing the desirable property of the program.  In the example above, this means that everywhere we can expect rectangles to be used, we can replace a rectangle with a square.  This was no longer true with the introduction of  setSize  method.",

It reads in Java source files as a string, parses the string for syntax errors, and converts the Java code into an intermediate binary format called the \nbytecode\n.  Bytecode is an instruction set akin to hardware instructions but is typically executed by a software interpreter.\n\n\nThis behavior is different from what \ngcc\n does for C programs.  \ngcc\n produces native machine code, corresponding to hardware instructions.  As such, a C program your \ngcc\n produced on your home machine will not run on \nsunfire\n.  \n\n\nJava designers (led by James Gosling) wanted a language that can be compiled into a form that is platform and hardware independent, thus, they developed their own runtime environment called the Java Virtual Machine (JVM), which interprets and executes the bytecode, optimizes the execution, and manages the memory of Java programs.  Bytecode produced (the \n.class\n files) on one platform can run other platforms.\n\n\n\n\nOther Bytecode Languages\n\n\nMany other programming environments offer compilation to bytecode.  Python, for instance, compiles Python code into \n.pyc\n files, which contain Python bytecode.  Facebook's HHVM compiles PHP into bytecode.  Google's V8 compiles Javascript into bytecode too.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOther JVM Languages\n\n\nWhile JVM was initially designed for Java, its popularity has led to the development of other languages that compile to JVM bytecode and run on JVM, such as Clojure, Groovy, Scala and Kotlin.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nOther Java Compilers\n\n\nWhile we stick to the Java 9 compiler from Oracle for CS2030, there are other Java compilers: \necj\n is the Java compiler from Eclipse -- if you use Eclipse IDE, this is the default compiler.  \ngcj\n is the GNU Java Compiler (which has been removed from GCC 7 onwards).\n\n\n\n\nOnce you produce the \n.class\n files containing the bytecode corresponding to the code you have written, you can pass the bytecode to JVM for execution by invoking the \njava\n command.  This is when your code gets executed -- objects get created and stored in memory, methods get called, etc. \n\n\nCompile Time vs Run Time\n\n\nIt is important to understand the difference between the two stages, compile time (when we invoke \njavac\n) and run time (when we invoke \njava\n).\n\n\nDuring compile time, the compiler does not always know what value a variable will take, nor will it know the sequence of execution of the programs.  As such, the compiler opts to be conservative and only makes the decision on what it knows for sure.  We have encountered this before -- recall our discussion on late binding:\n\n1\n2\n3\n  \nfor\n \n(\nPrintable\n \no\n:\n \nobjs\n)\n \n{\n\n      \no\n.\nprint\n();\n\n  \n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe compiler cannot always be sure what is the class of the object the variable \no\n will refer to during runtime, and thus, it cannot be sure which version of \nprint\n method will be executed.  \n\n\nIn another example, we have\n\n\n1\n2\n3\n  \nCircle\n \nc\n \n=\n \nnew\n \nCircle\n(\nnew\n \nPoint\n(\n0\n,\n0\n),\n \n10\n);\n\n  \nPrintable\n \nc2\n \n=\n \nc\n;\n\n  \nc2\n.\ngetArea\n();\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAt compile time, \nc2\n has a type \nPrintable\n, and we try to invoke \ngetArea\n which is a method available in \nCircle\n, not \nPrintable\n.  Even though if we trace through the three lines of code above, we (the humans) can be sure that \nc2\n is pointing to a \nCircle\n object and it is fine to call \ngetArea\n, the compiler has to be conservative as it is designed to work on arbitrarily complex programs with an unknown sequence of execution.  The compiler thus does not allow us to call \nc2.getArea()\n.\n\n\njshell\n\n\nIf we compile a program with \njavac\n and then execute it with \njava\n, we have two distinct phases.  An error reported by \njavac\n occurs during compilation and is a \ncompile time error\n.  An error reported by \njava\n occors during run time, and is a \nrun time error\n.  \n\n\nIf we \"play\" with our classes and with Java syntax using \njshell\n, however, the differences between compile time and run time error are blurred.  \njshell\n is an \"REPL\" tool, which stands for \"read-eval-print loop\", and it does exactly what the name says: it repeatedly reads in a Java statement, evaluates the statement, and prints out the result.  The reading step is analogous to compiling, while the evaluating and printing steps are analogous to running a program.  So, \njshell\n produces an error message, it could be due to an error triggered by either compile time or run time.\n\n\n1. Types\n\n\nThe above discussion brings us back to the topic of types.  Unlike C which is not type safe or  Python and Javascript which are weakly typed, Java belongs to a class of programming language which is statically typed and enforces type safety through a rich set of rules.  Understanding these rules and appreciating them is important to writing good and general Java programs, as well as picking up other statically and strongly typed programming languages.\n\n\nType Conversion\n\n\nSometimes a programmer knows better than the compiler the intention of the program.  In this case, it is useful for a programmer to override the compiler's decision.  One possible such override is to force the type of a variable to be something more appropriate, through \ntype casting\n.\n\n\nWe have seen type casting in action when we discussed about type safety (see \nLecture 1\n).  Recall that, in C, we can type cast two seemingly incompatible types to each other.  We have also seen it \nlast week\n when we cast an \nObject\n variable to a \nCircle\n when we discuss overriding of the \nequals()\n method.\n\n\nType casting is a form of type conversion, in particular, an \nexplicit type conversion\n. \n\n\nLet's talk about \nimplicit type conversion\n first.  Implicit conversion can happen in several contexts:\n\n\n\n\nAssignment, for instance, assigning a variable of type \nCircle\n to a variable of type `Shape.\n\n\nMethod invocation, for instance, when you pass a variable of type \nCircle\n to a method expecting \nShape\n.\n\n\nString conversion, when one of the operands of \n+\n is a \nString\n and the other is not, in which case it will be converted to \nString\n (by calling \ntoString()\n).\n\n\n\n\nSuppose we have a reference type \n\\(S\\)\n and \n\\(T\\)\n is a subtype of \n\\(S\\)\n (denoted \n\\(T <: S\\)\n), then converting \n\\(T\\)\n to \n\\(S\\)\n is checked at compile time.  This conversion is known as \nwidening reference conversion\n.\n\n\nThe converse is not true.  If we want to convert \n\\(S\\)\n to \n\\(T\\)\n (known as \nnarrowing reference conversion\n), then we need explicit casting.  Such conversion is checked at run time, and it may cause an exception.  \n\n\n 1\n 2\n 3\n 4\n 5\n 6\n 7\n 8\n 9\n10\n11\n12\n13\nclass\n \nS\n \n{\n \n}\n\n\nclass\n \nT\n \nextends\n \nS\n \n{\n \n}\n\n\nclass\n \nU\n \nextends\n \nS\n \n{\n \n}\n \n\n\nS\n \ns1\n,\n \ns2\n;\n\n\nT\n \nt\n \n=\n \nnew\n \nT\n();\n\n\nU\n \nu\n \n=\n \nnew\n \nU\n();\n\n\n\ns1\n \n=\n \nt\n;\n  \n// always OK since this is a widening reference conversion.\n\n\ns2\n \n=\n \nu\n;\n  \n// always OK since this is a widening reference conversion.\n\n\nt\n  \n=\n \ns1\n;\n \n// not allowed since it is a narrowing reference conversion.\n\n\nt\n  \n=\n \n(\nT\n)\ns1\n;\n \n// explicit conversion allowed by compiler, no problem during run time.\n\n\nt\n  \n=\n \n(\nT\n)\ns2\n;\n \n// explicit conversion allowed by compiler, but cause run time error.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJava subtyping and conversion specification\n\n\nWe are not going through all the gory details of Java subtyping and type conversion rules.  Chapter 5 of \nJava Language Specification\n succinctly and precisely defines all the rules on this topic.  For those students who are interested, you can check it out.  Otherwise, we will discover some of the other rules along the way as we learn more about Java in practice.\n\n\n\n\nSubtyping\n\n\nWe have seen how subtyping works in Java: we say that if a class \n\\(T\\)\n extends from class \n\\(S\\)\n or implements interface \n\\(S\\)\n, \n\\(T\\)\n is a subtype of \n\\(S\\)\n.  The notion of subtyping, however, is more general than that.  In the study of programming languages, we say that \n\\(T\\)\n is a subtype of \n\\(S\\)\n if a piece of code written for variables of type \n\\(S\\)\n can also safely be used on variables of type \n\\(T\\)\n.   In the context of Java and other OO languages, inheritance and implementation of interfaces satisfy these conditions.  In other languages, however, we can create subtypes without these OO notions.  In Ada, for instance, we can create a subtype by restricting the range of values of a type.  E.g., we can create a subtype \ndigit\n from the type \nint\n, restricting its value to ranging between 0 and 9.\n\n\nWith this more general notion of subtyping, we can define subtype relations between the primitive types, as follows:\n\n\nbyte\n \n\\(<:\\)\n \nshort\n \n\\(<:\\)\n \nint\n \n\\(<:\\)\n \nlong\n \n\\(<:\\)\n \nfloat\n \n\\(<:\\)\n \ndouble\n; and \nchar\n \n\\(<:\\)\n \nint\n\n\nWe can also extend the notion of widening conversion and narrowing conversion to primitive types.\n\n\nVariance of Types\n\n\nGiven a type \n\\(T\\)\n, we can create other complex types that depend on \n\\(T\\)\n.  For instance, we can have an array of type \n\\(T\\)\n, a generic class parameterized by \n\\(T\\)\n (next lecture), a method that takes in \n\\(T\\)\n and returns \n\\(T\\)\n, etc.\n\n\nThe term \nvariance of types\n refers to how these more complex types relate to each other, given the relationship between the simpler types.\n\n\nSuppose \n\\(A(T)\\)\n is the complex type constructed from \n\\(T\\)\n.  Then we say that \n\n\n\n\n\\(A\\)\n is \ncovariant\n if \n\\(T <: S\\)\n implies \n\\(A(T) <: A(S)\\)\n, \n\n\n\\(A\\)\n is \ncontravariant\n if \n\\(T <: S\\)\n implies \n\\(A(S) <: A(T)\\)\n,\n\n\n\\(A\\)\n is \nbivariant\n if it is both covariant and contravariant, and\n\n\n\\(A\\)\n is \ninvariant\n if it is neither covariant nor contravariant.\n\n\n\n\nFor example, in Java, arrays (of reference type) are covariant.  This means that, \nT[]\n is a subtype of \nS[]\n, if \nT\n is a subtype of \nS\n.  Based on the type conversion rule, it is OK to assign any array of reference type to an array of \nObject\n objects, or pass an array of reference type to a method that expects an array of \nObject\n objects.  This decision (of making Java arrays covariant) makes it possible to write very generic method that operates on array, as provided by the Java utility class \nArrays\n.\n1\n\n\nWe will see examples of complex type \n\\(A\\)\n that is invariant and contravariant later in this module.\n\n\n2. Heap and Stack\n\n\nAs mentioned earlier, JVM manages memory of Java programs while its bytecode instructions are interpreted and executed.  Different JVM implementation may implement these differently, but typically a JVM implementation partitions the memory into several regions, including\n- \nmethod area\n for storing the code for the methods;\n- \nmetaspace\n for storing meta information about classes;\n- \nheap\n for storing dynamically allocated objects;\n- \nstack\n for local variables and call frames.\n\n\nSince the concepts of heap and stack are common to all execution environments (either based on bytecode or machine code), we will focus on them here.\n\n\nThe \nheap\n is the region in memory where all objects are allocated in and stored, while the \nstack\n is the region where all variables (including primitive types and object references) are allocated in and stored.\n\n\nConsiders the following two lines of code.\n\n1\n2\nCircle\n \nc\n;\n\n\nc\n \n=\n \nnew\n \nCircle\n(\nnew\n \nPoint\n(\n1\n,\n \n1\n),\n \n8\n);\n\n\n\n\n\nLine 1 declares a variable \nc\n.  When Java executes this line of code, it allocates some memory space for an object reference for \nc\n, the content is initialized to \nnull\n.  Since \nc\n is a variable, it resides in the stack.\n\n\n\n\nnull\n in Java\n\n\nnull\n is a special value for the object reference, that signifies that this reference is not pointing to any object.  This is similar to the \nnull\n in Javascript, \nNULL\n macro in C, \nnullptr\n in C++11, \nNone\n in Python, \nnil\n in Objective-C.  (Again, you see here computer scientists just can't agree on names!)  \nSir Tony Hoare\n (who also invented quicksort) famously apologized for inventing the null pointer.  He calls it his billion-dollar mistake.\n\n\n\n\nLine 2 creates a new Circle object.  When Java executes this line of code, it allocates some memory space for a \nCircle\n object on the heap.  The memory address of this memory space becomes the reference of the object and is assigned to the variable \nc\n.\n\n\nThis is shown in the figure below\n2\n.\n\n\n\n\nThe first argument to \nCircle\n constructor is also an object, so to be more precise, when Line 2 above is executed, a \nPoint\n object is also created and allocated on the heap.  So the field \nc\n inside \nCircle\n is actually a reference to this object.\n\n\n\n\nNow, let's look at a slightly different example.\n\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\nCircle\n \nc\n;\n\n\nPoint\n \ncenter\n;\n\n\ndouble\n \nradius\n;\n\n\nradius\n \n=\n \n8\n;\n\n\ncenter\n \n=\n \nnew\n \nPoint\n(\n1\n,\n \n1\n);\n\n\nc\n \n=\n \nnew\n \nCircle\n(\ncenter\n,\n \nradius\n);\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the second example, we have three variables, \nc\n, \ncenter\n, and \nradius\n .  Lines 1-3 declare the variables, and as a result, we have three variables allocated on the stack.  Recall that for object references, they are initialized to \nnull\n.  Primitive type variables (e.g., \nradius\n) are initialized to 0.\n\n\n\n\nAfter Lines 4-6, we have:\n\n\n\n\nCall Stack\n\n\nNow, let's look at what happens when we invoke a method.  Take the \ndistanceTo\n method in \nPoint\n as an example:\n\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\nclass\n \nPoint\n \n{\n\n  \nprivate\n \ndouble\n \nx\n;\n\n  \nprivate\n \ndouble\n \ny\n;\n\n  \npublic\n \ndouble\n \ndistanceTo\n(\nPoint\n \nq\n)\n \n{\n\n    \nreturn\n \nMath\n.\nsqrt\n((\nq\n.\nx\n \n-\n \nthis\n.\nx\n)*(\nq\n.\nx\n \n-\n \nthis\n.\nx\n)+(\nq\n.\ny\n \n-\n \nthis\n.\ny\n)*(\nq\n.\ny\n \n-\n \nthis\n.\ny\n));\n\n  \n}\n\n\n}\n\n\n\n\n\nand the invocation:\n\n1\n2\n3\nPoint\n \np1\n \n=\n \nnew\n \nPoint\n(\n0\n,\n0\n);\n\n\nPoint\n \np2\n \n=\n \nnew\n \nPoint\n(\n1\n,\n1\n);\n\n\np1\n.\ndistanceTo\n(\np2\n);\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter declaring \np1\n and \np2\n and creating both objects, we have:\n\n\n\nWhen \ndistanceTo\n is called, JVM creates a \nstack frame\n for this instance method call.  This stack frame is a region of memory that tentatively contains (i) the \nthis\n reference, (ii) the method arguments, and (iii) local variables within the method, among other things\n3\n4\n.  When a class method is called, the stack frame does not contain the \nthis\n reference.\n\n\n\n\nYou can see that the \nreferences\n to the objects \np1\n and \np2\n are copied onto the stack frame. \np1\n and \nthis\n point to the same object, and \np2\n and \nq\n point to the same object.\nWithin the method, any modification done to \nthis\n would change the object referenced to by \np1\n, and any change made to \nq\n would change the object referenced to by \np2\n as well.\nAfter the method returns, the stack frame for that method is destroyed.\n\n\nLet's call the \nmove\n function from your \nLab 0\n, with arguments \n(double theta, double d)\n.\n\n\n1\n2\n3\ndouble\n \ntheta\n \n=\n \nMath\n.\nPI\n/\n4.0\n;\n\n\ndouble\n \ndistance\n \n=\n \n1\n;\n\n\np2\n.\nmove\n(\ntheta\n,\n \ndistance\n);\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAgain, we create a stack frame, copy the reference to object \np2\n into \nthis\n, copy \ntheta\n from the calling function to \ntheta\n the argument within the method, copy \ndistance\n from the calling function to \nd\n the argument within the method.  Recall that, in this function, you actually change the \nx\n and \ny\n of \nthis\n to move \np2\n.  \n\n\n\n\nWhat is important here is that, as \ntheta\n and \ndistance\n are primitive types instead of references, we copy the values onto the stack.  If we change \ntheta\n or \nd\n within \nmove\n, the \ntheta\n and \ndistance\n of the calling function will not change.  This behavior is the same as you would expect in C.  However, unlike in C where you can pass in a pointer to a variable, you cannot pass in a reference to a primitive type in any way in Java.  If you want to pass in a variable of primitive type into a method and have its value changed, you will have to use a \nwrapper class\n.  The details of how to do this are left as an exercise.\n\n\nTo summarize, Java uses \ncall by value\n for primitive types, and \ncall by reference\n for objects.\n\n\nIf we made multiple nested method calls, as we usually do, the stack frames get stacked on top of each other.  For instance, in Lab 0, \nmain\n calls \nsolve\n, which calls the \nCircle\n constructor, which calls the \nangleTo\n.  When JVM is executing \nangleTo\n, the call stack contains the stack frames of (in order of top to bottom): \nangleTo\n, \nCircle\n constructor, \nsolve\n, and \nmain\n.\n\n\nOne final note: the memory allocated on the stack are deallocated when a method returns.  The memory allocated on the heap, however, stays there as long as there is a reference to it (either from another object or from a variable in the stack).  Unlike C or C++, in Java, you do not have to free the memory allocated to objects.  The JVM runs a \ngarbage collector\n  that checks for unreferenced objects on the heap and cleans up the memory automatically.\n\n\n3. Exceptions\n\n\nOne of the nuances of programming is having to write code to deal with exceptions and errors.  Consider writing a method that reads in a series of x and y coordinates from a file, not unlike what you have seen in Lab 0.  Here are some things that could go wrong:\n\n\n\n\nThe file to read from may not exist\n\n\nThe file to read from exists, but you may not have permission to read it\n\n\nYou can open the file for reading, but it might contain non-numeric text where you numerical values\n\n\nThe file might contain fewer values than expected\n\n\nThe file might become unreadable as you are reading through it (e.g., someone unplugs the USB drive)\n\n\n\n\nIn C, we usually have to write code like this:\n\n\n 1\n 2\n 3\n 4\n 5\n 6\n 7\n 8\n 9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\nfd\n \n=\n \nfopen\n(\nfilename\n,\n\"r\"\n);\n\n\nif\n \n(\nfd\n \n==\n \nNULL\n)\n \n{\n\n  \nfprintf\n(\nstderr\n,\n \n\"Unable to open file. \"\n);\n\n  \nif\n \n(\nerrno\n \n==\n \nENFILE\n)\n \n{\n\n    \nfprintf\n(\nstderr\n,\n \n\"Too many opened files.  Unable to open another\n\\n\n\"\n);\n\n  \n}\n \nelse\n \nif\n \n(\nerrno\n \n==\n \nENOENT\n)\n \n{\n\n    \nfprintf\n(\nstderr\n,\n \n\"No such file %s\n\\n\n\"\n,\n \nfilename\n);\n\n  \n}\n \nelse\n \nif\n \n(\nerrno\n \n==\n \nEACCES\n)\n \n{\n\n    \nfprintf\n(\nstderr\n,\n \n\"No read permission to %s\n\\n\n\"\n,\n \nfilename\n);\n\n  \n}\n\n  \nreturn\n \n-\n1\n;\n\n\n}\n\n\nscanned\n \n=\n \nfscanf\n(\nfd\n,\n \n\"%d\"\n,\n \n&\nnum_of_points\n);\n\n\nif\n \n(\nscanned\n \n==\n \n0\n)\n \n{\n\n  \nfprintf\n(\nstderr\n,\n \n\"Unable to scan for an integer\n\\n\n\"\n);\n\n  \nfclose\n(\nfd\n);\n\n  \nreturn\n \n-\n2\n;\n\n\n}\n\n\nif\n \n(\nscanned\n \n==\n \nEOF\n)\n \n{\n\n  \nfprintf\n(\nstderr\n,\n \n\"No input found.\n\\n\n\"\n);\n\n  \nfclose\n(\nfd\n);\n\n  \nreturn\n \n-\n3\n;\n\n\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOut of the lines above, only 2 lines correspond to the actual tasks, the others are for exception checking/handling.  How uncool is that?  Furthermore, the actual tasks are interspersed between exception checking code, making reading and understanding the logic of the code difficult.\n\n\nThe examples above also have to return different values to the calling method, because the calling method may have to do something to handle the errors.  Note that the POSIX APIs has a global variable \nerrno\n that signifies the detailed error.  First, we have to check for different \nerrno\n values and react accordingly (we can use \nperror\n, but that has its limits).  Second, \nerrno\n is global and we know that using global variable is bad practice.  In fact, I am not even sure that code above works because \nfprintf\n in Line 3 might have changed \nerrno\n!\n\n\nThen, there is the issue of having to repeatedly clean up after an error -- here we \nfclose\n the file if there is an error reading, twice.  It is easy to forget to do so if we have to do this in multiple places.   Furthermore, if we need to perform more complex clean up, then we would end up with lots of repeated code.\n\n\nFortunately, Java supports \ntry\n/\ncatch\n/\nfinally\n control statements, which is a way to group statements that check/handle errors together making code easier to read.  The Java equivalent to the above is:\n\n\n 1\n 2\n 3\n 4\n 5\n 6\n 7\n 8\n 9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\ntry\n \n{\n\n  \nreader\n \n=\n \nnew\n \nFileReader\n(\nfilename\n);\n\n  \nscanner\n \n=\n \nnew\n \nScanner\n(\nreader\n);\n\n  \nnumOfPoints\n \n=\n \nscanner\n.\nnextInt\n();\n\n\n}\n\n\ncatch\n \n(\nFileNotFoundException\n \ne\n)\n \n{\n\n    \nSystem\n.\nerr\n.\nprintln\n(\n\"Unable to open \"\n \n+\n \nfilename\n \n+\n \n\" \"\n \n+\n \ne\n);\n\n\n}\n\n\ncatch\n \n(\nInputMismatchException\n \ne\n)\n \n{\n\n    \nSystem\n.\nerr\n.\nprintln\n(\n\"Unable to scan for an integer\"\n);\n\n\n}\n\n\ncatch\n \n(\nNoSuchElementException\n \ne\n)\n \n{\n\n    \nSystem\n.\nerr\n.\nprintln\n(\n\"No input found\"\n);\n\n\n}\n\n\nfinally\n \n{\n\n  \nif\n \n(\nscanner\n \n!=\n \nnull\n)\n\n    \nscanner\n.\nclose\n();\n\n\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere Lines 2-4 keep the basic tasks together, and all the clean up tasks are grouped together in Lines 18-19.  Lines 8-16 handle the exceptions.  We no longer rely on a global variable to convey the type of exceptions, or special return value to indicate exceptions.   What if we want the calling method to handle the exception?  Then, we simply do not do anything (i.e., do not catch the exception) and let the exception propagates to the calling method automatically.\n\n\n\n\nError vs. Exception in Java\n\n\nWe have been using the term error and exception loosely.  Java has different classes for \nError\n and \nException\n.  \nError\n is for situations where the program should terminate as generally there is no way to recover.  For instance, when the heap is full (\nOutOfMemoryError\n) or the stack is full (\nStackOverflowError\n).  Exceptions are for situations where it is still possible to reasonably recover from the error.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCombining Multiple Catches\n\n\nIn cases where the code to handle the exceptions is the same, you can\n\n1\n2\n3\ncatch (FileNotFoundException | InputMismatchException | NoSuchElementException e) {\n    System.err.println(e);\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere is a more detailed description of the control flow of exceptions.  Consider we have a \ntry\n-\ncatch\n-\nfinally\n block that catches two exceptions \nE1\n and \nE2\n.  Inside the \ntry\n block, we call a method \nm1()\n; \nm1()\n calls \nm2()\n; \nm2()\n calls \nm3()\n, and \nm3()\n calls \nm4()\n.   In a normal (no exception) situation, the control flow looks like this:\n\n\n\n\nThe statements in \ntry\n block are executed, followed by the statements in \nfinally\n block.\n\n\nNow, let's suppose something went wrong deep inside the nested call, in \nm4()\n.  One of the statement executes \nthrow new E2();\n, which causes the execution in \nm4()\n to stop.  JVM now looks for the block of code that catches \nE2\n, going down the call stack, until it can find a place where the exception is handled.  In this example, we suppose that none of \nm1()\n-\nm4()\n handles (i.e., \ncatch\n) the exception.  Thus, JVM then jumps to the code that handles \nE2\n.  Finally, JVM executes the \nfinally\n block.\n\n\nNote that the \nfinally\n block is always executed even when \nreturn\n or \nthrow\n is called in a \ncatch\n block.\n\n\n\n\nChecked Exceptions\n\n\nThere are two types of exceptions in Java: \nchecked\n and \nunchecked\n exceptions:\n\n\n\n\nA checked exception is something that the programmer should anticipate and handle.  For instance, when you open a file, you should anticipate that in some cases, the file cannot be open.   \n\n\nAn unchecked exception is something that the programmer does not anticipate, and usually is a result of a bug.  For example, when you try to call \np.distanceTo(q)\n but \np\n is \nnull\n, \nNullPointerException\n will be thrown.  \n\n\n\n\nWe need to either catch all checked exceptions or let it propagate to the calling method\n.  Otherwise, the program will not compile.  \n\n\nFor unchecked exceptions, even though we could catch it, it makes more sense to eliminate the bugs.  In Java, unchecked exceptions are subclasses of \nRuntimeException\n.  All \nError\ns are unchecked.\n\n\nAll methods that throw checked exception need to \nspecify\n the checked exception(s).  For example, if we want to put the code to open a file and read an \nint\n from it into a function, and want the calling function to deal with the exception, this is what we should do:\n\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\npublic\n \nstatic\n \nint\n \nreadIntFromFile\n(\nString\n \nfilename\n)\n\n  \nthrows\n \nFileNotFoundException\n \n{\n\n  \nFileReader\n \nreader\n \n=\n \nnew\n \nFileReader\n(\nfilename\n);\n\n  \nScanner\n \nscanner\n \n=\n \nnew\n \nScanner\n(\nreader\n);\n\n  \nint\n \nnumOfPoints\n \n=\n \nscanner\n.\nnextInt\n();\n    \n  \nscanner\n.\nclose\n();\n\n  \nreturn\n \nnumOfPoints\n;\n\n\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote Line 2 specify that this method might throw \nFileNotFoundException\n.  \n\n\nA checked exception must be either caught or thrown to calling function, except \nmain\n, which has no calling function to throw to.  If \nmain\n does not catch a checked exception, the program exits, and the exception is revealed to the user -- this is generally considered a bad programming practice.\n\n\nThe two other exceptions from the examples above \nInputMismatchException\n and \nNoSuchElementException\n are subclasses of \nRuntimeException\n, and therefore are unchecked.\n\n\nGenerating Exception\n\n\nThe Circle constructor in Lab 0 requires the distance \n\\(d\\)\n between two input points to be \n\\(0 < d \\le 2r\\)\n.  If the condition is violated, you are asked to return an invalid circle.  A better way is to throw an unchecked exception \nIllegalArgumentException\n if one of the above two conditions is met.  \n\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\npublic\n \nCircle\n(\nPoint\n \np\n,\n \nPoint\n \nq\n,\n \ndouble\n \nr\n,\n \nboolean\n \ncenterOnLeft\n)\n \n{\n\n  \nif\n \n(\np\n.\ndistanceTo\n(\nq\n)\n \n>\n \n2\n*\nr\n)\n \n{\n\n    \nthrow\n \nnew\n \nIllegalArgumentException\n(\n\"Input points are too far apart\"\n);\n\n  \n}\n\n  \nif\n \n(\np\n.\nequals\n(\nq\n))\n \n{\n\n    \nthrow\n \nnew\n \nIllegalArgumentException\n(\n\"Input points coincide\"\n);\n\n  \n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote that difference between \nthrow\n and \nthrows\n: the former is to generate an exception, the latter to specify that the exception(s) thrown by a method.\n\n\nIf you find that none of the \nexceptions provided by Java\n meet your needs, you can create your own exceptions, by simply inheriting from one of the existing ones.\nBut, you should only do so if there is a good reason, for instance, to provide additional useful information to the exception handler.\n\n\nOverriding Method that Throws Exceptions\n\n\nWhen you override a method that throws a checked exception, the overriding method must throw only the same, or a more specific checked exception, than the overridden method.  This rule enforces the Liskov Substitution Principle.  The caller of the overridden method cannot expect any new checked exception than what has already been \"promised\" in the method specification.\n\n\nGood Practices for Exception Handling\n\n\nCatch Exceptions to Clean Up\n\n\nWhile it is convenient to just let the calling method deals with exceptions (\"Hey! Not my problem!\"), it is not always responsible to do so.  Consider the example earlier, where \nm1()\n, \nm2()\n, and \nm3()\n do not handle exception E2.  Let's say that E2 is a checked exception, and it is possible to react to this and let the program continues properly.  Also, suppose that \nm2()\n allocated some system resources (e.g., temporary files, network connections) at the beginning of the method, and deallocated the resources at the end of the method.  Not handling the exception, means that, code that deallocates these resources does not get called when an exception occurs!  It is better for \nm2()\n to catch the exception, handle the resource deallocation in a \nfinally\n block.  If there is a need for the calling methods to be aware of the exception, \nm2()\n can always re-throw the exception:\n\n\n 1\n 2\n 3\n 4\n 5\n 6\n 7\n 8\n 9\n10\n11\n12\npublic\n \nvoid\n \nm2\n()\n \nthrows\n \nE2\n \n{\n\n  \ntry\n \n{\n\n    \n// setup resources\n\n    \nm3\n();\n\n  \n}\n\n  \ncatch\n \n(\nE2\n \ne\n)\n \n{\n\n    \nthrow\n \ne\n;\n\n  \n}\n\n  \nfinally\n \n{\n\n    \n// clean up resources\n\n  \n}\n\n\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCatch All Exception is Bad\n\n\nSometimes, you just want to focus on the main logic of the program and get it working instead of dealing with the exceptions.  Since Java uses checked exceptions, it forces you to handle the exceptions or else your code will not compile.  One way to quickly get around this is to write:\n\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\ntry\n \n{\n\n  \n// your code\n\n\n}\n\n\ncatch\n \n(\nException\n \ne\n)\n \n{\n\n  \n:\n\n\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nto shut the compiler up.  DO NOT DO THIS.  All exceptions thrown are now silently ignored!  This is such as bad practice that there is a name for this -- this is call the \nPokemon Exception Handling\n.\n\n\nCan we do \nworse\n?  How about the following:\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\ntry\n \n{\n\n  \n// your code\n\n\n}\n\n\ncatch\n \n(\nError\n \ne\n)\n \n{\n\n  \n:\n\n\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\ud83d\ude31\n\n\nOverreacting\n\n\nDo not exit a program just because of exception.  This would prevent the calling function from cleaning up their resources.  Worse, do not exit a program silently.\n\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\ntry\n \n{\n\n  \n// your code\n\n\n}\n\n\ncatch\n \n(\nException\n \ne\n)\n \n{\n\n  \nSystem\n.\nexit\n(\n0\n);\n\n\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDo Not Break Abstraction Barrier\n\n\nSometimes, letting the calling method handles the exception causes the implementation details to be leaked, and make it harder to change the implementation later.\n\n\nFor instance, suppose we design a class \nClassRoster\n with a method \ngetStudents()\n, which reads the list of students from a text file.\n\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\nclass\n \nClassRoster\n \n{\n\n   \n:\n\n  \npublic\n \nStudents\n[]\n \ngetStudents\n()\n \nthrows\n \nFileNotFoundException\n \n{\n\n    \n:\n\n  \n}\n\n\n}\n\n\n\n\n\nLater, we change the implementation to reading the list from an SQL database,\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\nclass\n \nClassRoster\n \n{\n\n   \n:\n\n  \npublic\n \nStudents\n[]\n \ngetStudents\n()\n \nthrows\n \nSQLException\n \n{\n\n    \n:\n\n  \n}\n\n\n}\n\n\n\n\n\nWe should, as much as possible, handle the implementation specific exceptions within the abstraction barrier.  \n\n\nExercise\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSuppose we have an interface \nShape\n and two classes \nCircle\n and \nSquare\n that implements \nShape\n.  We initialize the following variables:\n\n\n1\n2\nShape\n[]\n \nshapes\n;\n\n\nCircle\n[]\n \ncircles\n \n=\n \nnew\n \nCircle\n[\n1\n];\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWill the following two lines compile?  Will any of the lines cause a run time exception?  Explain.\n\n1\n2\nshapes\n \n=\n \ncircles\n;\n\n\nshapes\n[\n0\n]\n \n=\n \nnew\n \nSquare\n(\n3.0\n);\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Assume \nSquare\n has a constructor that takes in a single \ndouble\n argument.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWrite a static method with the following signature:\n\n\n1\npublic\n \nstatic\n \nboolean\n \nsearch\n(\nObject\n[]\n \na\n,\n \nObject\n \ntarget\n)\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nto search linearly through the array \na\n to see if there exists an element of \na\n that equals to \ntarget\n (the equality is tested using the \nequals\n method).  The method returns \ntrue\n if the \ntarget\n is found, and returns \nfalse\n otherwise.\n\n\nFor instance, \n\n\n1\n2\n3\nPoint\n[]\n \npoints\n \n=\n \n{\n \nnew\n \nPoint\n(\n0\n,\n0\n),\n \nnew\n \nPoint\n(\n0\n,\n1\n),\n \nnew\n \nPoint\n(\n0\n,\n2\n)\n \n};\n\n\nsearch\n(\npoints\n,\n \nnew\n \nPoint\n(\n0\n,\n1\n));\n \n// return true\n\n\nsearch\n(\npoints\n,\n \nnew\n \nPoint\n(\n1\n,\n1\n));\n \n// return false\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTake note of how method overriding, polymorphism, widening type conversion, and the covariance property of Java array are used in this question.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn Java, we cannot write a method to swap two primitive types without going through some hoops.  For instance, the following does not work:\n\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\nstatic\n \nvoid\n \nswap\n(\nint\n \nx\n,\n \nint\n \ny\n)\n \n{\n\n  \nint\n \ntmp\n \n=\n \nx\n;\n\n  \nx\n \n=\n \ny\n;\n\n  \ny\n \n=\n \ntmp\n;\n\n\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy? \n\n\nTo pass a variable of primitive type by reference, we need to wrap the variable in a wrapper class.  For example,\n\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\nclass\n \nWrapper\n \n{\n\n  \npublic\n \nint\n \nx\n;\n\n  \npublic\n \nint\n \ny\n;\n\n\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUsing the \nWrapper\n class above to pass the two variables \nx\n and \ny\n into the \nswap\n method to swap their values.

            "text": "Now that we have gone through the basic concepts of OO programming, let's take a step away from OO for the moment and look at some other important features of Java.  In your  Lab 0 , we showed you how to use  javac  to compile your Java program and  java  to execute your program.    javac  is a  compiler . It reads in Java source files as a string, parses the string for syntax errors, and converts the Java code into an intermediate binary format called the  bytecode .  Bytecode is an instruction set akin to hardware instructions but is typically executed by a software interpreter.  This behavior is different from what  gcc  does for C programs.   gcc  produces native machine code, corresponding to hardware instructions.  As such, a C program your  gcc  produced on your home machine will not run on  sunfire .    Java designers (led by James Gosling) wanted a language that can be compiled into a form that is platform and hardware independent, thus, they developed their own runtime environment called the Java Virtual Machine (JVM), which interprets and executes the bytecode, optimizes the execution, and manages the memory of Java programs.  Bytecode produced (the  .class  files) on one platform can run other platforms.   Other Bytecode Languages  Many other programming environments offer compilation to bytecode.  Python, for instance, compiles Python code into  .pyc  files, which contain Python bytecode.  Facebook's HHVM compiles PHP into bytecode.  Google's V8 compiles Javascript into bytecode too.    Other JVM Languages  While JVM was initially designed for Java, its popularity has led to the development of other languages that compile to JVM bytecode and run on JVM, such as Clojure, Groovy, Scala and Kotlin.      Other Java Compilers  While we stick to the Java 9 compiler from Oracle for CS2030, there are other Java compilers:  ecj  is the Java compiler from Eclipse -- if you use Eclipse IDE, this is the default compiler.   gcj  is the GNU Java Compiler (which has been removed from GCC 7 onwards).   Once you produce the  .class  files containing the bytecode corresponding to the code you have written, you can pass the bytecode to JVM for execution by invoking the  java  command.  This is when your code gets executed -- objects get created and stored in memory, methods get called, etc.",

            "text": "It is important to understand the difference between the two stages, compile time (when we invoke  javac ) and run time (when we invoke  java ).  During compile time, the compiler does not always know what value a variable will take, nor will it know the sequence of execution of the programs.  As such, the compiler opts to be conservative and only makes the decision on what it knows for sure.  We have encountered this before -- recall our discussion on late binding: 1\n2\n3    for   ( Printable   o :   objs )   { \n       o . print (); \n   }    The compiler cannot always be sure what is the class of the object the variable  o  will refer to during runtime, and thus, it cannot be sure which version of  print  method will be executed.    In another example, we have  1\n2\n3    Circle   c   =   new   Circle ( new   Point ( 0 , 0 ),   10 ); \n   Printable   c2   =   c ; \n   c2 . getArea ();    At compile time,  c2  has a type  Printable , and we try to invoke  getArea  which is a method available in  Circle , not  Printable .  Even though if we trace through the three lines of code above, we (the humans) can be sure that  c2  is pointing to a  Circle  object and it is fine to call  getArea , the compiler has to be conservative as it is designed to work on arbitrarily complex programs with an unknown sequence of execution.  The compiler thus does not allow us to call  c2.getArea() .",

One possible such override is to force the type of a variable to be something more appropriate, through  type casting .  We have seen type casting in action when we discussed about type safety (see  Lecture 1 ).  Recall that, in C, we can type cast two seemingly incompatible types to each other.  We have also seen it  last week  when we cast an  Object  variable to a  Circle  when we discuss overriding of the  equals()  method.  Type casting is a form of type conversion, in particular, an  explicit type conversion .   Let's talk about  implicit type conversion  first.  Implicit conversion can happen in several contexts:   Assignment, for instance, assigning a variable of type  Circle  to a variable of type `Shape.  Method invocation, for instance, when you pass a variable of type  Circle  to a method expecting  Shape .  String conversion, when one of the operands of  +  is a  String  and the other is not, in which case it will be converted to  String  (by calling  toString() ).   Suppose we have a reference type  \\(S\\)  and  \\(T\\)  is a subtype of  \\(S\\)  (denoted  \\(T <: S\\) ), then converting  \\(T\\)  to  \\(S\\)  is checked at compile time.  This conversion is known as  widening reference conversion .  The converse is not true.  If we want to convert  \\(S\\)  to  \\(T\\)  (known as  narrowing reference conversion ), then we need explicit casting.  Such conversion is checked at run time, and it may cause an exception.     1\n 2\n 3\n 4\n 5\n 6\n 7\n 8\n 9\n10\n11\n12\n13 class   S   {   }  class   T   extends   S   {   }  class   U   extends   S   {   }   S   s1 ,   s2 ;  T   t   =   new   T ();  U   u   =   new   U ();  s1   =   t ;    // always OK since this is a widening reference conversion.  s2   =   u ;    // always OK since this is a widening reference conversion.  t    =   s1 ;   // not allowed since it is a narrowing reference conversion.  t    =   ( T ) s1 ;   // explicit conversion allowed by compiler, no problem during run time.  t    =   ( T ) s2 ;   // explicit conversion allowed by compiler, but cause run time error.     Java subtyping and conversion specification  We are not going through all the gory details of Java subtyping and type conversion rules.  Chapter 5 of  Java Language Specification  succinctly and precisely defines all the rules on this topic.  For those students who are interested, you can check it out.  Otherwise, we will discover some of the other rules along the way as we learn more about Java in practice.",

The notion of subtyping, however, is more general than that.  In the study of programming languages, we say that  \\(T\\)  is a subtype of  \\(S\\)  if a piece of code written for variables of type  \\(S\\)  can also safely be used on variables of type  \\(T\\) .   In the context of Java and other OO languages, inheritance and implementation of interfaces satisfy these conditions.  In other languages, however, we can create subtypes without these OO notions.  In Ada, for instance, we can create a subtype by restricting the range of values of a type.  E.g., we can create a subtype  digit  from the type  int , restricting its value to ranging between 0 and 9.  With this more general notion of subtyping, we can define subtype relations between the primitive types, as follows:  byte   \\(<:\\)   short   \\(<:\\)   int   \\(<:\\)   long   \\(<:\\)   float   \\(<:\\)   double ; and  char   \\(<:\\)   int  We can also extend the notion of widening conversion and narrowing conversion to primitive types.",

Suppose  \\(A(T)\\)  is the complex type constructed from  \\(T\\) .  Then we say that    \\(A\\)  is  covariant  if  \\(T <: S\\)  implies  \\(A(T) <: A(S)\\) ,   \\(A\\)  is  contravariant  if  \\(T <: S\\)  implies  \\(A(S) <: A(T)\\) ,  \\(A\\)  is  bivariant  if it is both covariant and contravariant, and  \\(A\\)  is  invariant  if it is neither covariant nor contravariant.   For example, in Java, arrays (of reference type) are covariant.  This means that,  T[]  is a subtype of  S[] , if  T  is a subtype of  S .  Based on the type conversion rule, it is OK to assign any array of reference type to an array of  Object  objects, or pass an array of reference type to a method that expects an array of  Object  objects.

            "text": "As mentioned earlier, JVM manages memory of Java programs while its bytecode instructions are interpreted and executed.  Different JVM implementation may implement these differently, but typically a JVM implementation partitions the memory into several regions, including\n-  method area  for storing the code for the methods;\n-  metaspace  for storing meta information about classes;\n-  heap  for storing dynamically allocated objects;\n-  stack  for local variables and call frames.  Since the concepts of heap and stack are common to all execution environments (either based on bytecode or machine code), we will focus on them here.  The  heap  is the region in memory where all objects are allocated in and stored, while the  stack  is the region where all variables (including primitive types and object references) are allocated in and stored.  Considers the following two lines of code. 1\n2 Circle   c ;  c   =   new   Circle ( new   Point ( 1 ,   1 ),   8 );   \nLine 1 declares a variable  c .  When Java executes this line of code, it allocates some memory space for an object reference for  c , the content is initialized to  null .  Since  c  is a variable, it resides in the stack.   null  in Java  null  is a special value for the object reference, that signifies that this reference is not pointing to any object.  This is similar to the  null  in Javascript,  NULL  macro in C,  nullptr  in C++11,  None  in Python,  nil  in Objective-C.  (Again, you see here computer scientists just can't agree on names!)   Sir Tony Hoare  (who also invented quicksort) famously apologized for inventing the null pointer.  He calls it his billion-dollar mistake.   Line 2 creates a new Circle object.  When Java executes this line of code, it allocates some memory space for a  Circle  object on the heap.  The memory address of this memory space becomes the reference of the object and is assigned to the variable  c .  This is shown in the figure below 2 .   The first argument to  Circle  constructor is also an object, so to be more precise, when Line 2 above is executed, a  Point  object is also created and allocated on the heap.  So the field  c  inside  Circle  is actually a reference to this object.   Now, let's look at a slightly different example.  1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6 Circle   c ;  Point   center ;  double   radius ;  radius   =   8 ;  center   =   new   Point ( 1 ,   1 );  c   =   new   Circle ( center ,   radius );    In the second example, we have three variables,  c ,  center , and  radius  .  Lines 1-3 declare the variables, and as a result, we have three variables allocated on the stack.  Recall that for object references, they are initialized to  null .  Primitive type variables (e.g.,  radius ) are initialized to 0.   After Lines 4-6, we have:",

            "text": "Now, let's look at what happens when we invoke a method.  Take the  distanceTo  method in  Point  as an example:  1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7 class   Point   { \n   private   double   x ; \n   private   double   y ; \n   public   double   distanceTo ( Point   q )   { \n     return   Math . sqrt (( q . x   -   this . x )*( q . x   -   this . x )+( q . y   -   this . y )*( q . y   -   this . y )); \n   }  }   \nand the invocation: 1\n2\n3 Point   p1   =   new   Point ( 0 , 0 );  Point   p2   =   new   Point ( 1 , 1 );  p1 . distanceTo ( p2 );    After declaring  p1  and  p2  and creating both objects, we have:  When  distanceTo  is called, JVM creates a  stack frame  for this instance method call.  This stack frame is a region of memory that tentatively contains (i) the  this  reference, (ii) the method arguments, and (iii) local variables within the method, among other things 3 4 .  When a class method is called, the stack frame does not contain the  this  reference.   You can see that the  references  to the objects  p1  and  p2  are copied onto the stack frame.  p1  and  this  point to the same object, and  p2  and  q  point to the same object.\nWithin the method, any modification done to  this  would change the object referenced to by  p1 , and any change made to  q  would change the object referenced to by  p2  as well.\nAfter the method returns, the stack frame for that method is destroyed.  Let's call the  move  function from your  Lab 0 , with arguments  (double theta, double d) .  1\n2\n3 double   theta   =   Math . PI / 4.0 ;  double   distance   =   1 ;  p2 . move ( theta ,   distance );    Again, we create a stack frame, copy the reference to object  p2  into  this , copy  theta  from the calling function to  theta  the argument within the method, copy  distance  from the calling function to  d  the argument within the method.  Recall that, in this function, you actually change the  x  and  y  of  this  to move  p2 .     What is important here is that, as  theta  and  distance  are primitive types instead of references, we copy the values onto the stack.  If we change  theta  or  d  within  move , the  theta  and  distance  of the calling function will not change.  This behavior is the same as you would expect in C.  However, unlike in C where you can pass in a pointer to a variable, you cannot pass in a reference to a primitive type in any way in Java.  If you want to pass in a variable of primitive type into a method and have its value changed, you will have to use a  wrapper class .  The details of how to do this are left as an exercise.  To summarize, Java uses  call by value  for primitive types, and  call by reference  for objects.  If we made multiple nested method calls, as we usually do, the stack frames get stacked on top of each other.  For instance, in Lab 0,  main  calls  solve , which calls the  Circle  constructor, which calls the  angleTo .  When JVM is executing  angleTo , the call stack contains the stack frames of (in order of top to bottom):  angleTo ,  Circle  constructor,  solve , and  main .  One final note: the memory allocated on the stack are deallocated when a method returns.  The memory allocated on the heap, however, stays there as long as there is a reference to it (either from another object or from a variable in the stack).  Unlike C or C++, in Java, you do not have to free the memory allocated to objects.  The JVM runs a  garbage collector   that checks for unreferenced objects on the heap and cleans up the memory automatically.",

Consider writing a method that reads in a series of x and y coordinates from a file, not unlike what you have seen in Lab 0.

How uncool is that?  Furthermore, the actual tasks are interspersed between exception checking code, making reading and understanding the logic of the code difficult.  The examples above also have to return different values to the calling method, because the calling method may have to do something to handle the errors.  Note that the POSIX APIs has a global variable  errno  that signifies the detailed error.  First, we have to check for different  errno  values and react accordingly (we can use  perror , but that has its limits).  Second,  errno  is global and we know that using global variable is bad practice.  In fact, I am not even sure that code above works because  fprintf  in Line 3 might have changed  errno !  Then, there is the issue of having to repeatedly clean up after an error -- here we  fclose  the file if there is an error reading, twice.  It is easy to forget to do so if we have to do this in multiple places.   Furthermore, if we need to perform more complex clean up, then we would end up with lots of repeated code.  Fortunately, Java supports  try / catch / finally  control statements, which is a way to group statements that check/handle errors together making code easier to read.  The Java equivalent to the above is:   1\n 2\n 3\n 4\n 5\n 6\n 7\n 8\n 9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18 try   { \n   reader   =   new   FileReader ( filename ); \n   scanner   =   new   Scanner ( reader ); \n   numOfPoints   =   scanner . nextInt ();  }  catch   ( FileNotFoundException   e )   { \n     System . err . println ( \"Unable to open \"   +   filename   +   \" \"   +   e );  }  catch   ( InputMismatchException   e )   { \n     System . err . println ( \"Unable to scan for an integer\" );  }  catch   ( NoSuchElementException   e )   { \n     System . err . println ( \"No input found\" );  }  finally   { \n   if   ( scanner   !=   null ) \n     scanner . close ();  }    Here Lines 2-4 keep the basic tasks together, and all the clean up tasks are grouped together in Lines 18-19.  Lines 8-16 handle the exceptions.  We no longer rely on a global variable to convey the type of exceptions, or special return value to indicate exceptions.   What if we want the calling method to handle the exception?  Then, we simply do not do anything (i.e., do not catch the exception) and let the exception propagates to the calling method automatically.   Error vs. Exception in Java  We have been using the term error and exception loosely.  Java has different classes for  Error  and  Exception .   Error  is for situations where the program should terminate as generally there is no way to recover.  For instance, when the heap is full ( OutOfMemoryError ) or the stack is full ( StackOverflowError ).  Exceptions are for situations where it is still possible to reasonably recover from the error.    Combining Multiple Catches  In cases where the code to handle the exceptions is the same, you can 1\n2\n3 catch (FileNotFoundException | InputMismatchException | NoSuchElementException e) {\n    System.err.println(e);\n}    Here is a more detailed description of the control flow of exceptions.  Consider we have a  try - catch - finally  block that catches two exceptions  E1  and  E2 .  Inside the  try  block, we call a method  m1() ;  m1()  calls  m2() ;  m2()  calls  m3() , and  m3()  calls  m4() .   In a normal (no exception) situation, the control flow looks like this:   The statements in  try  block are executed, followed by the statements in  finally  block.  Now, let's suppose something went wrong deep inside the nested call, in  m4() .  One of the statement executes  throw new E2(); , which causes the execution in  m4()  to stop.  JVM now looks for the block of code that catches  E2 , going down the call stack, until it can find a place where the exception is handled.  In this example, we suppose that none of  m1() - m4()  handles (i.e.,  catch ) the exception.  Thus, JVM then jumps to the code that handles  E2 .  Finally, JVM executes the  finally  block.  Note that the  finally  block is always executed even when  return  or  throw  is called in a  catch  block.",

For instance, when you open a file, you should anticipate that in some cases, the file cannot be open.     An unchecked exception is something that the programmer does not anticipate, and usually is a result of a bug.  For example, when you try to call  p.distanceTo(q)  but  p  is  null ,  NullPointerException  will be thrown.     We need to either catch all checked exceptions or let it propagate to the calling method .  Otherwise, the program will not compile.    For unchecked exceptions, even though we could catch it, it makes more sense to eliminate the bugs.  In Java, unchecked exceptions are subclasses of  RuntimeException .  All  Error s are unchecked.  All methods that throw checked exception need to  specify  the checked exception(s).  For example, if we want to put the code to open a file and read an  int  from it into a function, and want the calling function to deal with the exception, this is what we should do:  1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8 public   static   int   readIntFromFile ( String   filename ) \n   throws   FileNotFoundException   { \n   FileReader   reader   =   new   FileReader ( filename ); \n   Scanner   scanner   =   new   Scanner ( reader ); \n   int   numOfPoints   =   scanner . nextInt ();     \n   scanner . close (); \n   return   numOfPoints ;  }    Note Line 2 specify that this method might throw  FileNotFoundException .    A checked exception must be either caught or thrown to calling function, except  main , which has no calling function to throw to.  If  main  does not catch a checked exception, the program exits, and the exception is revealed to the user -- this is generally considered a bad programming practice.

If there is a need for the calling methods to be aware of the exception,  m2()  can always re-throw the exception:   1\n 2\n 3\n 4\n 5\n 6\n 7\n 8\n 9\n10\n11\n12 public   void   m2 ()   throws   E2   { \n   try   { \n     // setup resources \n     m3 (); \n   } \n   catch   ( E2   e )   { \n     throw   e ; \n   } \n   finally   { \n     // clean up resources \n   }  }",

Write a static method with the following signature:  1 public   static   boolean   search ( Object []   a ,   Object   target )     to search linearly through the array  a  to see if there exists an element of  a  that equals to  target  (the equality is tested using the  equals  method).  The method returns  true  if the  target  is found, and returns  false  otherwise.

So far, the parent class that we have seen is a \nconcrete\n class -- it has fields and methods, complete with method implementation.  Such concrete parent class can be instantiated into objects.   \n\n\nOn the other hand, we have \npure\n interfaces, which is completely virtual or abstract.  It declares what public methods it should provide -- together with, for each method, the return type, the exception(s) it throws, and its method signature.  It can only have constant fields\n1\n and no implementation.\n\n\nBetween these two extremes, there are two other possibilities in Java:\n\n\n\n\nAn \nabstract class\n, which is just like a class, but it is declared as \nabstract\n, and some of its methods are declared as \nabstract\n, without implementation.  An abstract class cannot be instantiated, and any subclass who wish to be concrete needs to implement these abstract methods.\n\n 1\n 2\n 3\n 4\n 5\n 6\n 7\n 8\n 9\n10\n11\nabstract\n \nclass\n \nPaintedShape\n \n{\n\n  \nColor\n \nfillColor\n;\n\n    \n:\n\n  \nvoid\n \nfillWith\n(\nColor\n \nc\n)\n \n{\n\n    \nfillColor\n \n=\n \nc\n;\n\n  \n}\n\n    \n:\n\n  \nabstract\n \ndouble\n \ngetArea\n();\n\n  \nabstract\n \ndouble\n \ngetPerimeter\n();\n\n    \n:\n\n\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAn interface with default implementations.  Introduced only in Java 8, with the goal of allowing an interface to evolve, an interface can now contain default implementation of its methods.  Such interface still cannot be instantiated into objects, but classes that implement such interface need not provide an implementation for a method where a default implementation exists.  For instance, we can have:\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\ninterface\n \nShape\n \n{\n\n  \npublic\n \ndouble\n \ngetArea\n();\n\n  \npublic\n \ndouble\n \ngetPerimeter\n();\n\n  \npublic\n \nboolean\n \ncontains\n(\nPoint\n \np\n);\n\n  \ndefault\n \npublic\n \nboolean\n \ncover\n(\nPoint\n \np\n)\n \n{\n\n    \nreturn\n \ncontains\n(\np\n);\n\n  \n}\n\n\n}\n\n\n\n\n\nwhere \ncover\n is a new method with default implementation, denoted with keyword \ndefault\n.  \n\n\n\n\nThe reason Java 8 introduced default methods for interface is for backward compatibility.  For instance, the implementer of \nShape\n can add \ncover\n to a new version of interface \nShape\n without breaking all the existing code that implements \nShape\n.\n\n\nAbstract class, however, should be used in general in the design of a class hierarchy -- in a case where it is more meaningful for the subclass to implement its own method than the superclass.  For example, in the \nPaintedShape\n abstract class above, it can implement the methods related to styles, but it is not meaningful to provide an implementation of \ngetArea\n and \ngetPerimeter\n. We will see more examples of abstract class later.\n\n\nGenerics\n\n\nNow let's move on to the topic of generics.\nSuppose you want to create a new class that encapsulates a queue of circles.  You wrote:\n\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\nclass\n \nCircleQueue\n \n{\n\n  \nprivate\n \nCircle\n[]\n \ncircles\n;\n\n   \n:\n\n  \npublic\n \nCircleQueue\n(\nint\n \nsize\n)\n \n{...}\n\n  \npublic\n \nboolean\n \nisFull() {\n...}\n\n  \npublic\n \nboolean\n \nisEmpty() {\n...}\n\n  \npublic\n \nvoid\n \nenqueue\n(\nCircle\n \nc\n)\n \n{...}\n\n  \npublic\n \nCircle\n \ndequeue() {\n...}\n\n\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLater, you found that you need a new class that encapsulates a queue of points.  You wrote:\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\nclass\n \nPointQueue\n \n{\n\n  \nprivate\n \nPoint\n[]\n \npoints\n;\n\n   \n:\n\n  \npublic\n \nPointQueue\n(\nint\n \nsize\n)\n \n{...}\n\n  \npublic\n \nboolean\n \nisFull() {\n...}\n\n  \npublic\n \nboolean\n \nisEmpty() {\n...}\n\n  \npublic\n \nvoid\n \nenqueue\n(\nPoint\n \np\n)\n \n{...}\n\n  \npublic\n \nPoint\n \ndequeue() {\n...}\n\n\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd you realize that there are actually a lot of similar code.  Invoking the \nabstraction principle\n, which states that \n\"Where similar functions are carried out by distinct pieces of code, it is generally beneficial to combine them into one by abstracting out the varying parts\n\", you decided to create a queue of Objects to replace the two classes above.\n\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\nclass\n \nObjectQueue\n \n{\n\n  \nprivate\n \nObject\n[]\n \nobjects\n;\n\n   \n:\n\n  \npublic\n \nObjectQueue\n(\nint\n \nsize\n)\n \n{...}\n\n  \npublic\n \nboolean\n \nisFull\n()\n \n{...}\n\n  \npublic\n \nboolean\n \nisEmpty\n()\n \n{...}\n\n  \npublic\n \nvoid\n \nenqueue\n(\nObject\n \no\n)\n \n{...}\n\n  \npublic\n \nObject\n \ndequeue\n()\n \n{...}\n\n\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow you have a very general class, that you can use to store objects of any kind, including a queue of strings, a queue of colors, etc.  You are quite pleased with yourself, as you should!  The early Java collection library contains many such generic data structures that stores elements of type \nObject\n.\n\n\nTo create a queue of 10 circles and add some circles, you just need:\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\nObjectQueue\n \ncq\n \n=\n \nnew\n \nObjectQueue\n(\n10\n);\n\n\ncq\n.\nenqueue\n(\nnew\n \nCircle\n(\nnew\n \nPoint\n(\n0\n,\n \n0\n),\n \n10\n));\n\n\ncq\n.\nenqueue\n(\nnew\n \nCircle\n(\nnew\n \nPoint\n(\n1\n,\n \n1\n),\n \n5\n));\n\n \n:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGetting a circle out of the queue is a bit more troublesome:\n\n1\nCircle\n \nc\n \n=\n \ncq\n.\ndequeue\n();\n\n\n\n\n\nWould generate a compilation error, since we are trying to perform a narrowing reference conversion -- we cannot assign a variable of type \nObject\n to a variable of type \nCircle\n without type casting:\n\n\n1\nCircle\n \nc\n \n=\n \n(\nCircle\n)\ncq\n.\ndequeue\n();\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs we have seen in \nLecture 4\n, the code above might generate a runtime \nClassCastException\n if there is an object in the queue that is not \nCircle\n or its subclass.  To avoid runtime error, we should check the type first:\n\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\nObject\n \no\n \n=\n \ncq\n.\ndequeue\n();\n\n\nif\n \n(\no\n \ninstanceof\n \nCircle\n)\n \n{\n\n    \nCircle\n \nc\n \n=\n \n(\nCircle\n)\no\n;\n\n\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWouldn't it be nice if we can still have code that is general, but we let the compiler generates an error if we try to add a non-\nCircle\n into our queue of \nCircle\n objects, so that we don't have to check for the type of an object all the time?\n\n\nJava 5 introduces generics, which is a significant improvement to the type systems in Java.  It allows a \ngeneric class\n or a \ngeneric interface\n of some type \nT\n to be written:\n\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\nclass\n \nQueue\n<\nT\n>\n \n{\n\n  \nprivate\n \nT\n[]\n \nobjects\n;\n\n   \n:\n\n  \npublic\n \nQueue\n<\nT\n>(\nint\n \nsize\n)\n \n{...}\n\n  \npublic\n \nboolean\n \nisFull\n()\n \n{...}\n\n  \npublic\n \nboolean\n \nisEmpty\n()\n \n{...}\n\n  \npublic\n \nvoid\n \nenqueue\n(\nT\n \no\n)\n \n{...}\n\n  \npublic\n \nT\n \ndequeue\n()\n \n{...}\n\n\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nT\n is known as \ntype parameter\n.\nThe same code as before can be written as:\n\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\nQueue\n<\nCircle\n>\n \ncq\n \n=\n \nnew\n \nQueue\n<\nCircle\n>(\n10\n);\n\n\ncq\n.\nenqueue\n(\nnew\n \nCircle\n(\nnew\n \nPoint\n(\n0\n,\n \n0\n),\n \n10\n));\n\n\ncq\n.\nenqueue\n(\nnew\n \nCircle\n(\nnew\n \nPoint\n(\n1\n,\n \n1\n),\n \n5\n));\n\n\nCircle\n \nc\n \n=\n \ncq\n.\ndequeue\n();\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere, we pass \nCircle\n as the \ntype argument\n to \nT\n, creating a \nparameterized type\n \nQueue<Circle>\n.\n\n\nIn Line 4, we no longer need to cast, and there is no danger of runtime error due to an object of the wrong class being added to the queue, for doing this:\n\n1\n2\nQueue\n<\nCircle\n>\n \ncq\n \n=\n \nnew\n \nQueue\n<\nCircle\n>(\n10\n);\n\n\ncq\n.\nenqueue\n(\nnew\n \nPoint\n(\n1\n,\n \n3\n));\n\n\n\n\n\nwill generate a compile-time error.\n\n\nGeneric typing is a type of polymorphism as well and is also known as \nparametric polymorphism\n.\n\n\n\n\nIn Other Languages\n\n\nMany modern programming languages support generics: C++ (known as \ntemplate\n), Swift, Kotlin, C#, etc. For dynamically typed languages such as Python, one can already write generic code without regards to the type of the variables, so generic is kinda \"build in\".  In C (the 2011 version, C11), there is a \n_Generic\n expression, which is not to be confused with generics we are talking about here.\n\n\n\n\nWe can use parameterized type anywhere a type is used, including as type argument.  If we want to have a queue of a queue of circles, we can:\n\n\n1\nQueue\n<\nQueue\n<\nCircle\n>>\n \ncqq\n \n=\n \nnew\n \nQueue\n<>(\n10\n);\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVariance of Generic Types\n\n\nIn \nLecture 4\n, we discuss about subtypes and the variance of types.  Recall that \n\\(T\\)\n is a subtype of \n\\(S\\)\n if everywhere we use \n\\(S\\)\n, we can substitute with \n\\(T\\)\n.  \n\n\nSuppose a class or interface \nB\n is a subtype of \nA\n, then \nB<T>\n is also a subtype of \nA<T>\n, i.e., they are covariant.\n\n\nGenerics, however, are \ninvariant\n, with respect to the type parameter.  That is, if a class or interface \nB\n is a subtype of \nA\n, then neither is \nC<B>\n a subtype of \nC<A>\n, nor is \nC<A>\n a subtype of \nC<B>\n.  A parameterized type must be used with exactly with same type argument.  For instance:\n\n\n1\n2\n3\nQueue\n<\nCircle\n>\n \nqc\n \n=\n \nnew\n \nQueue\n<\nShape\n>();\n  \n// error\n\n\nQueue\n<\nShape\n>\n \nqs\n \n=\n \nnew\n \nQueue\n<\nCircle\n>();\n \n// error\n\n\nQueue\n<\nShape\n>\n \nqs\n \n=\n \n(\nQueue\n<\nCircle\n>)\n \nnew\n \nQueue\n<\nCircle\n>();\n \n// error\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwill lead to compile-time error.  Attempting to type cast just like when we do a narrowing reference conversion will fail as well.\n\n\nWildcards\n\n\nSubtyping among generic types are achieved through wildcard types \n?\n.  \n?\n itself is not a type, but a notation to denote variance of generic types.  We can replace type parameter \nT\n with \n?\n, to indicate that \nT\n can be any type.  This creates a subtype relationship.  For instance, \nQueue<Shape>\n is a subtype of \nQueue\n<?\n>\n, \nQueue<Object>\n is a subtype of \nQueue\n<?\n>\n.\n\n\n1\nQueue\n<?\n>\n \nqc\n \n=\n \nnew\n \nQueue\n<\nShape\n>\n();\n   \n// OK\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSince the wildcard \n?\n is not a type, we cannot declare a class like this:\n\n1\n2\n3\nclass\n \nBar\n<?>\n \n{\n\n    \nprivate\n \n?\n \nx\n;\n\n\n}\n\n\n\n\n\nWe only use \n?\n when specifying the type of a variable, field, or parameter.\n\n\nWildcards can be bounded.  Java uses the keyword \nextends\n and \nsuper\n to specify the bound.  For instance, \nQueue<Circle>\n and \nQueue<Shape>\n are both subtypes of \nQueue\n<?\n \nextends\n \nShape\n>\n, but \nQueue<Object>\n is not a subtype of \nQueue\n<?\n>\n.\n\n\nTo be more general, if \nT\n is a subtype of \nS\n, then \nQueue<T>\n is a subtype of \nQueue\n<?\n \nextends\n \nS\n>\n.  In other words, the use of \n? extends\n is covariant.  \n\n\nThe \nsuper\n keyword is used to specify the contravariant relationship.\nIf \nT\n is a subtype of \nS\n, then \nQueue<S>\n is a subtype of \nQueue\n<?\n \nsuper\n \nT\n>\n.  \n\n\nMore intuitively, we can replace \n? extends X\n with type X or any subtype that extends X; \n? super X\n with type X or any supertype of X.\n\n\n\n\nWildcard type in Other Languages\n\n\nThe use of wildcard type \n?\n is not common in other programming languages.  Partly because Java introduces generics late and has to use type erasure to implement generic types.\n\n\n\n\nType Erasure\n\n\nIn Java, for backward compatibility, generic typing is implemented with a process called \ntype erasure\n.  The type argument is erased during compile time, and the type parameter \nT\n is replaced with either \nObject\n (if it is unbounded) or the bound (if it is bounded). For instance, \nQueue<Circle>\n will be replaced by \nQueue\n and \nT\n will be replaced by \nObject\n, just like how Java code is written before generic type is introduced in Java 5.  \nQueue\n<?\n \nextends\n \nShape\n>\n will be replaced with \nQueue\n and \nT\n will be replaced with \nShape\n.  The compiler also inserts type casting and additional methods\n2\n to preserve the semantics of generic type.\n\n\nJava's design decision to use type erasure to implement generics has several important implications.  \n\n\nFirst, unlike other languages, such as C++, Java does not support generics of a primitive type.  We cannot create a \nQueue<int>\n, for instance.  We can only use reference types as type argument (anything that is a subtype of \nObject\n).\n\n\nSecond, we cannot have code that looks like the following:\n\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\nclass\n \nA\n \n{\n\n  \nvoid\n \nfoo\n(\nQueue\n<\nCircle\n>\n \nc\n)\n \n{}\n\n  \nvoid\n \nfoo\n(\nQueue\n<\nPoint\n>\n \nc\n)\n \n{}\n\n\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEven though both \nfoo\n above seem like they have different method signatures and is a valid application of method overloading, the compiler actually translates them both to:\n\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\nclass\n \nA\n \n{\n\n  \nvoid\n \nfoo\n(\nQueue\n \nc\n)\n \n{}\n\n  \nvoid\n \nfoo\n(\nQueue\n \nc\n)\n \n{}\n\n\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nand bummer, we have a compilation error!\n\n\nThird, using static methods or static fields in generic class becomes trickier.\n\n\nConsider the example \n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\nclass\n \nQueue\n<\nT\n>\n \n{\n\n  \nstatic\n \nint\n \nx\n \n=\n \n1\n;\n\n  \nstatic\n \nT\n \ny\n;\n\n  \nstatic\n \nT\n \nfoo\n(\nT\n \nt\n)\n \n{};\n\n\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQueue<Circle>\n and \nQueue<Point>\n both gets compiled to \nQueue\n.  So they share the same \nx\n, even though you might think \nQueue<CIrcle>\n and \nQueue<Point>\n as two different distinct classes.  \n\n\nFurther, the next two liens \nstatic T y\n and \nstatic T foo(T t) {}\n will generate a compilation error.  Since there will only be a copy of \ny\n shared by both \nQueue<Circle>\n and \nQueue<Point>\n, the compiler does not know whether to replace \nT\n with \nCircle\n or \nPoint\n, and will complain.\n\n\nFourth, we cannot create an array of parameterized types.\n\n\n1\n2\n3\nQueue\n<\nCircle\n>[]\n \ntwoQs\n \n=\n \nnew\n \nQueue\n<\nCircle\n>[\n2\n];\n \n// compiler error\n\n\ntwoQs\n[\n0\n]\n \n=\n \nnew\n \nQueue\n<\nCircle\n>();\n\n\ntwoQs\n[\n1\n]\n \n=\n \nnew\n \nQueue\n<\nPoint\n>();\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter type erasure, we get\n\n1\n2\n3\nQueue\n[]\n \ntwoQs\n \n=\n \nnew\n \nQueue\n[\n2\n];\n \n// compiler error\n\n\ntwoQs\n[\n0\n]\n \n=\n \nnew\n \nQueue\n();\n\n\ntwoQs\n[\n1\n]\n \n=\n \nnew\n \nQueue\n();\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf Java would have allowed us to create an array of a parameterized type, then we could have added an element of incompatible type \nQueue<Point>\n into an array of \nQueue<Circle>\n without raising a run-time error.  \n\n\nGenerics in Java is added as an afterthought and to maintain backward compatibility, the compiler has to erase the type parameter during compile type.  During runtime, the type information is no longer available, and this design causes the quirks above.\n\n\nRaw Types\n\n\nOne final note: for backward compatibility, Java allows us to use a generic class to be used without the type argument.  For instance, even though we declare \nQueue<T>\n, we can just use \nQueue\n.  \n\n\n1\nQueue\n<\nCircle\n>\n \ncq\n \n=\n \nnew\n \nQueue\n();\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter all, during compile time, \nQueue<Circle>\n is translated into \nQueue\n anyway.  In Java 5 or later, if we just use \nQueue\n, we get a \nQueue\n of \nObject\ns.  This is called a \nraw type\n.  Recent Java compilers will warn you if you use a raw type in your code.  \n\n\nWrapper Classes\n\n\nWe can get around the problem of not being able to create generics of primitive types using wrapper classes.  Java provides a set of wrapper classes, one for each primitive type: \nBoolean\n, \nByte\n, \nCharacter\n, \nInteger\n, \nDouble\n, \nLong\n, \nFloat\n, and \nShort\n.\n\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\nQueue\n<\nInteger\n>\n \niq\n \n=\n \nnew\n \nQueue\n<\nInteger\n>(\n10\n);\n\n\ncq\n.\nenqueue\n(\nnew\n \nInteger\n(\n4\n));\n\n\ncq\n.\nenqueue\n(\nnew\n \nInteger\n(\n8\n));\n\n\ncq\n.\nenqueue\n(\nnew\n \nInteger\n(\n15\n));\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJava 5 introduces something called \nautoboxing\n and \nunboxing\n, which creates the wrapper objects automatically (autoboxing) and retrieves its value (unboxing) automatically.  With autoboxing and unboxing, we can just write:\n\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\nQueue\n<\nInteger\n>\n \niq\n \n=\n \nnew\n \nQueue\n<\nInteger\n>(\n10\n);\n\n\ncq\n.\nenqueue\n(\n4\n);\n\n\ncq\n.\nenqueue\n(\n8\n);\n\n\ncq\n.\nenqueue\n(\n15\n);\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote that \nenqueue\n expects an \nInteger\n object, but we pass in an \nint\n.  This would cause the \nint\n variable to automatically be boxed (i.e., be wrapped in Integer object) and put onto the call stack of \nenqueue\n.\n\n\nPerformance Penalty\n\n\nIf the wrapper class is so great, why not use it all the time and forget about primitive types?\n\n\nThe answer: performance.  Because using an object comes with the cost of allocating memory for the object and collecting of garbage afterward, it is less efficient than primitive types.  Consider the following two programs:\n\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\nDouble\n \nsum\n;\n\n\nfor\n \n(\nint\n \ni\n \n=\n \n0\n;\n \ni\n \n<\n \nInteger\n.\nMAX_VALUE\n;\n \ni\n++)\n\n\n{\n\n    \nsum\n \n+=\n \ni\n;\n\n\n}\n\n\n\n\n\nvs.\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\ndouble\n \nsum\n;\n\n\nfor\n \n(\nint\n \ni\n \n=\n \n0\n;\n \ni\n \n<\n \nInteger\n.\nMAX_VALUE\n;\n \ni\n++)\n\n\n{\n\n    \nsum\n \n+=\n \ni\n;\n\n\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe second one is 2 times faster!  Due to autoboxing and unboxing, the cost of creating objects become hidden and often forgotten.\n\n\nAll primitive wrapper class objects are immutable -- once you create an object, it cannot be changed.  Thus, every time \nsum\n in the example above is updated, a new object gets created.\n\n\nGeneric Methods\n\n\nWe can get around the problem of not being able to define static methods using generic methods.  Generic methods are just like generic type, but the scope of the type parameter is limited to only the method itself.\n\n\n1\n2\n3\nclass\n \nQueue\n<\nT\n>\n \n{\n\n  \nstatic\n \n<\nT\n>\n \nT\n \nfoo\n(\nT\n \nt\n)\n \n{\n \nreturn\n \nt\n;\n \n};\n\n\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe above would compile.  Note that the \n<T>\n in \nstatic <T> T foo(T t)\n effectively declares a new type parameter \nT\n, scoped to the method \nfoo\n, and has nothing to do with the type parameter \n<T>\n for \nQueue<T>\n. \n\n(Recall that, since \nfoo\n is static and is associated with the class \nQueue\n).\n\n\nAs a convention, it is common to use the single letter \nT\n here, which may be confusing.  We can actually use any other single letter to represent the type parameter.\n\n1\n2\n3\nclass\n \nQueue\n<\nT\n>\n \n{\n\n  \nstatic\n \n<\nX\n>\n \nX\n \nfoo\n(\nX\n \nt\n)\n \n{\n \nreturn\n \nt\n;\n \n};\n\n\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo invoke a generic method, we can call it like this:\n\n1\nQueue\n.<\nPoint\n>\nfoo\n(\nnew\n \nPoint\n(\n0\n,\n \n0\n));\n\n\n\n\n\n\nor simply:\n\n1\nQueue\n.\nfoo\n(\nnew\n \nPoint\n(\n0\n,\n \n0\n));\n\n\n\n\n\n\nType Inference\n\n\nIn the last example, Java compiler uses \ntype inference\n to determine what \nT\n should be: in this case, we are passing in a \nPoint\n object, so \nT\n should be replaced with \nPoint\n.\n\n\nType inference can also be used with constructors.\n\n1\nQueue\n<\nPoint\n>\n \nq\n \n=\n \nnew\n \nQueue\n<>();\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the line above, we use the \ndiamond operator\n \n<>\n to ask Java to fill in the type for us.  Again, type inference allows Java to infer that we are creating a \nPoint\n object.\n\n\nIn cases where the type inference finds multiple matching types, the most specific type is chosen.\n\n\n\n\nLocal variable type inference in Java 10\n\n\nJava 10, which is scheduled to be released next month, supports type inference for a local variable.  We can write\n\n1\nvar\n \nq\n \n=\n \nnew\n \nQueue\n<\nPoint\n>();\n\n\n\n\n\nand Java 10 compiler can infer that q should have the type \nQueue<Point>\n.\n\n\n\n\nJava Collections\n\n\nNow, we turn our attention to the Java Collection Framework.  Java provides a rich set of classes for managing and manipulating data.  They efficiently implement many useful data structures (hash tables, red-black trees, etc.) and algorithms (sorting, searching, etc.) so that we no longer have to.  As computer scientists, it is still very important for us to know how these data structures and algorithms can be implemented, how to prove some behaviors (such as running time) and their correctness, how certain trade-offs are made, etc. They are so important that we have two modules dedicated to them, CS2040 and CS3230, in the core CS curriculum.\n\n\nIn CS2030, however, we will only use them but not study how to implement them.  Most importantly, Java Collection Framework is mostly well-designed and serves as real-world examples of how all the OO principles and programming language concepts are used.  We can see how all the things that we have learned so far is applied.\n\n\nCollection\n\n\nOne of the basic interfaces in Java Collection Framework is \nCollection<E>\n, it looks like:\n\n\n 1\n 2\n 3\n 4\n 5\n 6\n 7\n 8\n 9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\npublic\n \ninterface\n \nCollection\n<\nE\n>\n \nextends\n \nIterable\n<\nE\n>\n \n{\n\n  \nboolean\n \nadd\n(\nE\n \ne\n);\n\n  \nboolean\n \ncontains\n(\nObject\n \no\n);\n\n  \nboolean\n \nremove\n(\nObject\n \no\n);\n\n  \nvoid\n \nclear\n();\n\n  \nboolean\n \nisEmpty\n();\n\n  \nint\n \nsize\n();\n\n\n  \nObject\n[]\n \ntoArray\n();\n\n  \n<\nT\n>\n \nT\n[]\n \ntoArray\n(\nT\n[]\n \na\n);\n\n\n  \nboolean\n \naddAll\n(\nCollection\n<?\n \nextends\n \nE\n>\n \nc\n);\n\n  \nboolean\n \ncontainsAll\n(\nCollection\n<?>\n \nc\n);\n\n  \nboolean\n \nremoveAll\n(\nCollection\n<?>\n \nc\n);\n\n  \nboolean\n \nretainAll\n(\nCollection\n<?>\n \nc\n);\n\n    \n:\n\n\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are some newly added methods in Java 8 that we will visit in the second half of this module, but first,\nlet's try to understand what the definition above means.  First, like a generic class that you have seen, \nCollection\n is a \ngeneric interface\n parameterized with a type parameter \nE\n.  It extends a generic \nIterable<E>\n interface (we will get to this later).\n\n\nThe first six methods of \nCollection<E>\n should be self-explanatory.  \nadd\n adds an element into the collection; \ncontains\n checks if a given object is in the collection;  \nremove\n removes a single instance of the given object from the collection;  \nclear\n removes all objects from the collection;  \nisEmpty()\n checks if the collection has no elements or not; and finally, \nsize\n returns the number of elements.\n\n\nNote that \ncontains()\n relies on the implementation of \nequals()\n to check if the object exists in the collection or not.  Similarly, \nremove()\n relies on \nequals()\n to find the matching objects.  We said earlier that it is useful to override the \nequals\n methods of \nObject\n instead of implementing our own \nequals\n, because the overridden \nequals()\n will be called elsewhere.  This is one of the \"elsewhere\" I mentioned.  The documentation of \ncontains(o)\n mentions that it is guaranteed to return \ntrue\n if there exists an element \ne\n such that \ne.equals(o)\n or \ne == null\n (if \no == null\n).  Ditto for \nremove(o)\n.\n\n\n\n\nNon-generic Methods\n\n\nYou might notice that, instead of \ncontains(E e)\nand \nremove(E e)\n, the \nCollection\n interface uses \ncontains(Object o)\n and \nremove(Object o)\n.  This little inconsistency, however, is harmless.  For instance, if you have a collection intended for circles only, adding a non-circle could be disastrous.  Trying to remove a non-circle or checking for a non-circle, would just return false.\nMore information can be found on this \nStackOverflow\n thread.\n\n\n\n\nJava Collection Framework allows classes that implement an interface to throw an \nUnsupportedOperationException\n if the implementation decides not to implement one of the operations (but still need to have the method in the class).\n\n\nThe method \ntoArray()\n on Line 9 returns an array containing all the elements inside this collection.  The second overloaded \ntoArray\n method takes in an array of generic type \nT\n.  If the collections fit in \na\n, \na\n is filled and returned.  Else, it allocates a new array of type \nT\n and returned.\n\n\nThe second \ntoArray\n method is an example of a generic method.  It is the caller responsibility to pass in the right type, otherwise, an \nArrayStoreException\n will be thrown.\n\n\nThe next group of methods operates on another collection.  \naddAll\n add all the elements of collection \nc\n into the current collection; \ncontainsAll\n checks if all the elements of collection \nc\n are contained in the current collection; \nremoveAll\n removes all elements from collection \nc\n, and finally, \nretainsAll\n remove all elements not in \nc\n.\n\n\nWhat is more interesting about the methods is the type of \nc\n.  In \ncontainsAll\n, \nremoveAll\n, and \nretainAll\n, the collection \nc\n has the type \nCollection\n<?\n>\n.  Recall that \nCollection\n<?\n>\n is a supertype of \nCollection<T>\n, whatever \nT\n is.  So, we can pass in a \nCollection\n of any reference type to check for equality.  In this case, we are not adding anything to the collection, so the type of \nc\n is set to be as general as possible.\n\n\nIn \naddAll\n, however, \nc\n is declared as \nCollection\n<?\n \nextends\n \nE\n>\n.  Since we are adding to the collection, we can only add elements that either has the type \nE\n or a type that is a subtype of \nE\n.  This constraint is enforced during compile time through the covariance relationship between \nCollection\n<?\n \nextends\n \nE\n>\n and \nCollection<E>\n.\n\n\n\n\nIterable\n\n\nThe \nIterable<E>\n interface provides only a single method, \nIterator<E> iterator()\n, which returns a generic interface called \nIterator<E>\n over the collection.  An \nIterator\n is another interface that allows us to go through all the elements in a \nCollection<E>\n.  Useful methods include \nhasNext()\n, which returns if there is a next element in the \nCollection<E>\n; \nnext()\n, which returns the next element (with parameterized type \nE\n); and \nremove()\n, which removes the last returned element from the \nCollection<E>\n.\n\n\n\n\nSo far we have not seen any example code using \nCollection\n.  This is because Java Collection Framework does not provide a class that implements the \nCollection<E>\n directly.  The documentation recommends that we implement the \nCollection<E>\n interface\n3\n if we want a collection of objects that allows duplicates and does not care about the orders.\n\n\nSet and List\n\n\nThe \nSet<E>\n and \nList<E>\n interfaces extend the \nCollection<E>\n interface.  \nSet<E>\n is meant for implementing a collection of objects that does not allow duplicates (but still does not care about order of elements), while \nList<E>\n is for implementing a collection of objects that allow duplicates, but the order of elements matters.\n\n\nMathematically, a \nCollection<E>\n is used to represent a bag, \nSet<E>\n, a set, and \nList<E>\n, a sequence.\n\n\nThe \nList<E>\n interface has additional methods for adding and removing elements.  \nadd(e)\n by default would just add to the end of the list.  \nadd(i, e)\n inserts \ne\n to position \ni\n.  \nget(i)\n returns the element at position \ni\n, \nremove(i)\n removes the elements at position \ni\n; \nset(i,e)\n replace the \ni\n-th element with \ne\n.\n\n\nUseful classes in Java collection that implement \nList<E>\n include \nArrayList\n and \nLinkedList\n, and useful classes that implement \nSet<E>\n include \nHashSet\n.\n\n\nLet's see some examples:\n\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\nList\n<\nString\n>\n \nnames\n \n=\n \nnew\n \nArrayList\n();\n\n\nnames\n.\nadd\n(\n\"Cersei\"\n);\n\n\nnames\n.\nadd\n(\n\"Joffrey\"\n);\n\n\nnames\n.\nadd\n(\n0\n,\n \n\"Gregor\"\n);\n\n\nSystem\n.\nout\n.\nprintln\n(\nnames\n.\nget\n(\n1\n));\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLine 1 above creates an empty array list.  The second line adds two strings into the list, each appending them to the list.  After executing Line 3, it would contain the sequence \n<\"Cersei\",\"Joffrey\">\n.  Line 4 inserts the string \n\"Gregor\"\n to position 0, moving the rest of the list down by 1 position.  The sequence is now \n<\"Gregor\",\"Cersei\",\"Joffrey\">\n.  Finally, calling \nget(1)\n would return the string \n\"Cersei\"\n.\n\n\nNote that we declare \nnames\n with the interface type \nList<String>\n.  We should always do this to keep our code flexible.  If we want to change our implementation to \nLinkedList\n, we only need to change Line 1 to:\n\n1\nList\n<\nString\n>\n \nnames\n \n=\n \nnew\n \nLinkedList\n();\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComparator\n\n\nThe \nList<E>\n interface also specifies a \nsort\n method, with the following specification:\n\n1\ndefault\n \nvoid\n \nsort\n(\nComparator\n<?\n \nsuper\n \nE\n>\n \nc\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nList<E>\n is an example of an interface with default method.  The keyword \ndefault\n indicates that the interface \nList<E>\n comes with a default \nsort\n implementation, so a class that implements the interface needs not implement it again unless the class wants to override the method.\n\n\nThis method specification is also interesting and worth looking closer.  It takes in an object \nc\n with generic interface \nComparator\n<?\n \nsuper\n \nE\n>\n.  The \nComparator\n interface allows us to specify how to compare two elements, by implementing a \ncompare()\n method.  \ncompare(o1,o2)\n should return 0 if the two elements are equals, a negative integer if o1 is \"less than\" o2, and a positive integer otherwise.\n\n\nLet's write \nComparator\n class\n4\n:\n\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\nclass\n \nNameComparator\n \nimplements\n \nComparator\n<\nString\n>\n \n{\n\n    \npublic\n \nint\n \ncompare\n(\nString\n \ns1\n,\n \nString\n \ns2\n)\n \n{\n\n        \nreturn\n \ns1\n.\ncompareTo\n(\ns2\n);\n\n    \n}\n\n\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the above, we use the \ncompareTo\n method provided by the \nString\n class to do the comparison.  With the above, we can now sort the \nnames\n:\n\n\n1\nnames\n.\nsort\n(\nnew\n \nNameComparator\n());\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis would result in the sequence being changed to \n<\"Cersei\",\"Gregor\",\"Joffrey\">\n.  We can easily change how we want to sort the names, for instance, to\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\nclass\n \nNameComparator\n \nimplements\n \nComparator\n<\nString\n>\n \n{\n\n    \npublic\n \nint\n \ncompare\n(\nString\n \ns1\n,\n \nString\n \ns2\n)\n \n{\n\n        \nreturn\n \ns1\n.\nlength\n()\n \n-\n \ns2\n.\nlength\n();\n\n    \n}\n\n\n}\n\n\n\n\n\nif we want to sort by the length of the names.\n\n\nOne last thing to note about the method \nsort\n is that it takes in \nComparator\n<?\n \nsuper\n \nE\n>\n that is contravariant.  Recall that \nComparator<Object>\n is a subtype of \nComparator\n<?\n \nsuper\n \nE\n>\n, so we can pass in more general \nComparator\n object to \nsort\n (e.g., a class that implements \nComprator<Object>\n \n\n\nMap\n\n\nOne of the more powerful data structures provided by Java Collection is maps (also known as a dictionary in other languages).  A map allows us to store a (unique key, value) pair into the collection, and retrieve the value later by looking up the key.\n\n\nThe \nMap<K,V>\n interface is again generic, but this time, has two type parameters, \nK\n for the type of the key, and \nV\n for the type of the value.  These parameters make the \nMap\n interface flexible -- we can use any type as the key and value.\n\n\nThe two most important methods for \nMap\n is \nput\n and \nget\n:\n\n\n1\n2\n    \nV\n \nput\n(\nK\n \nkey\n,\n \nV\n \nvalue\n);\n\n    \nV\n \nget\n(\nObject\n \nk\n);\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA useful class that implements \nMap\n interface is \nHashMap\n:\n\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\nMap\n<\nString\n,\nInteger\n>\n \npopulation\n \n=\n \nnew\n \nHashMap\n<\nString\n,\nInteger\n>();\n\n\npopulation\n.\nput\n(\n\"Oldtown\"\n,\n500000\n);\n\n\npopulation\n.\nput\n(\n\"Kings Landing\"\n,\n500000\n);\n\n\npopulation\n.\nput\n(\n\"Lannisport\"\n,\n300000\n);\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLater, if we want to lookup the value, we can:\n\n1\npopulation\n.\nget\n(\n\"Kings Landing\"\n);\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhich Collection Class?\n\n\nJava provides many collection classes, more than what we have time to go through.  It is important to know which one to use to get the best performance out of them.  For the few classes we have seen:\n\n\n\n\nUse \nHashMap\n if you want to keep a (key, value) pair for lookup later.\n\n\nUse \nHashSet\n if you have a collection of elements with no duplicates and order is not important.\n\n\nUse \nArrayList\n if you have a collection of elements with possible duplicates and order is important, and retrieving a specific location is more important than removing elements from the list.\n\n\nUse \nLinkedList\n if you have a collection of elements with possibly duplicates and order is important, retriving a specific location is less important than removing elements from the list.\n\n\n\n\nYou should understand the reasons above after CS2040.\n\n\nFurther, if you want to check if a given object is contained in the list, then \nArrayList\n and \nLinkedList\n are not good candidates.  \nHashSet\n, on the other hand, can quickly check if an item is already contained in the set.  There is, unfortunately, no standard collection class that supports fast \ncontain\n and allow duplicates.  \n\n\nExercise\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConsider the following code snippet:\n    \n 1\n 2\n 3\n 4\n 5\n 6\n 7\n 8\n 9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\ninterface\n \nI\n \n{\n\n  \nvoid\n \nf\n();\n\n  \ndefault\n \ng\n()\n \n{\n \n  \n}\n\n\n}\n\n\n\nabstract\n \nclass\n \nA\n \nimplements\n \nI\n \n{\n\n  \nabstract\n \nvoid\n \nh\n();\n\n  \nabstract\n \nvoid\n \nh\n(\nint\n \nx\n);\n\n  \nvoid\n \nj\n()\n \n{\n\n  \n}\n\n\n}\n\n\n\nclass\n \nB\n \nextends\n \nA\n \n{\n\n  \n:\n\n\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClass \nB\n is a concrete class.

            "text": "We have seen how a class can inherit from a parent class, and implement one or more interfaces.  So far, the parent class that we have seen is a  concrete  class -- it has fields and methods, complete with method implementation.  Such concrete parent class can be instantiated into objects.     On the other hand, we have  pure  interfaces, which is completely virtual or abstract.  It declares what public methods it should provide -- together with, for each method, the return type, the exception(s) it throws, and its method signature.  It can only have constant fields 1  and no implementation.  Between these two extremes, there are two other possibilities in Java:   An  abstract class , which is just like a class, but it is declared as  abstract , and some of its methods are declared as  abstract , without implementation.  An abstract class cannot be instantiated, and any subclass who wish to be concrete needs to implement these abstract methods.  1\n 2\n 3\n 4\n 5\n 6\n 7\n 8\n 9\n10\n11 abstract   class   PaintedShape   { \n   Color   fillColor ; \n     : \n   void   fillWith ( Color   c )   { \n     fillColor   =   c ; \n   } \n     : \n   abstract   double   getArea (); \n   abstract   double   getPerimeter (); \n     :  }    An interface with default implementations.  Introduced only in Java 8, with the goal of allowing an interface to evolve, an interface can now contain default implementation of its methods.  Such interface still cannot be instantiated into objects, but classes that implement such interface need not provide an implementation for a method where a default implementation exists.  For instance, we can have: 1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8 interface   Shape   { \n   public   double   getArea (); \n   public   double   getPerimeter (); \n   public   boolean   contains ( Point   p ); \n   default   public   boolean   cover ( Point   p )   { \n     return   contains ( p ); \n   }  }   \nwhere  cover  is a new method with default implementation, denoted with keyword  default .     The reason Java 8 introduced default methods for interface is for backward compatibility.  For instance, the implementer of  Shape  can add  cover  to a new version of interface  Shape  without breaking all the existing code that implements  Shape .  Abstract class, however, should be used in general in the design of a class hierarchy -- in a case where it is more meaningful for the subclass to implement its own method than the superclass.  For example, in the  PaintedShape  abstract class above, it can implement the methods related to styles, but it is not meaningful to provide an implementation of  getArea  and  getPerimeter . We will see more examples of abstract class later.",

            "text": "Now let's move on to the topic of generics.\nSuppose you want to create a new class that encapsulates a queue of circles.  You wrote:  1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9 class   CircleQueue   { \n   private   Circle []   circles ; \n    : \n   public   CircleQueue ( int   size )   {...} \n   public   boolean   isFull() { ...} \n   public   boolean   isEmpty() { ...} \n   public   void   enqueue ( Circle   c )   {...} \n   public   Circle   dequeue() { ...}  }    Later, you found that you need a new class that encapsulates a queue of points.  You wrote: 1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9 class   PointQueue   { \n   private   Point []   points ; \n    : \n   public   PointQueue ( int   size )   {...} \n   public   boolean   isFull() { ...} \n   public   boolean   isEmpty() { ...} \n   public   void   enqueue ( Point   p )   {...} \n   public   Point   dequeue() { ...}  }    And you realize that there are actually a lot of similar code.  Invoking the  abstraction principle , which states that  \"Where similar functions are carried out by distinct pieces of code, it is generally beneficial to combine them into one by abstracting out the varying parts \", you decided to create a queue of Objects to replace the two classes above.  1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9 class   ObjectQueue   { \n   private   Object []   objects ; \n    : \n   public   ObjectQueue ( int   size )   {...} \n   public   boolean   isFull ()   {...} \n   public   boolean   isEmpty ()   {...} \n   public   void   enqueue ( Object   o )   {...} \n   public   Object   dequeue ()   {...}  }    Now you have a very general class, that you can use to store objects of any kind, including a queue of strings, a queue of colors, etc.  You are quite pleased with yourself, as you should!  The early Java collection library contains many such generic data structures that stores elements of type  Object .  To create a queue of 10 circles and add some circles, you just need: 1\n2\n3\n4 ObjectQueue   cq   =   new   ObjectQueue ( 10 );  cq . enqueue ( new   Circle ( new   Point ( 0 ,   0 ),   10 ));  cq . enqueue ( new   Circle ( new   Point ( 1 ,   1 ),   5 )); \n  :    Getting a circle out of the queue is a bit more troublesome: 1 Circle   c   =   cq . dequeue ();   \nWould generate a compilation error, since we are trying to perform a narrowing reference conversion -- we cannot assign a variable of type  Object  to a variable of type  Circle  without type casting:  1 Circle   c   =   ( Circle ) cq . dequeue ();    As we have seen in  Lecture 4 , the code above might generate a runtime  ClassCastException  if there is an object in the queue that is not  Circle  or its subclass.  To avoid runtime error, we should check the type first:  1\n2\n3\n4 Object   o   =   cq . dequeue ();  if   ( o   instanceof   Circle )   { \n     Circle   c   =   ( Circle ) o ;  }    Wouldn't it be nice if we can still have code that is general, but we let the compiler generates an error if we try to add a non- Circle  into our queue of  Circle  objects, so that we don't have to check for the type of an object all the time?  Java 5 introduces generics, which is a significant improvement to the type systems in Java.  It allows a  generic class  or a  generic interface  of some type  T  to be written:  1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9 class   Queue < T >   { \n   private   T []   objects ; \n    : \n   public   Queue < T >( int   size )   {...} \n   public   boolean   isFull ()   {...} \n   public   boolean   isEmpty ()   {...} \n   public   void   enqueue ( T   o )   {...} \n   public   T   dequeue ()   {...}  }    T  is known as  type parameter .\nThe same code as before can be written as:  1\n2\n3\n4 Queue < Circle >   cq   =   new   Queue < Circle >( 10 );  cq . enqueue ( new   Circle ( new   Point ( 0 ,   0 ),   10 ));  cq . enqueue ( new   Circle ( new   Point ( 1 ,   1 ),   5 ));  Circle   c   =   cq . dequeue ();    Here, we pass  Circle  as the  type argument  to  T , creating a  parameterized type   Queue<Circle> .  In Line 4, we no longer need to cast, and there is no danger of runtime error due to an object of the wrong class being added to the queue, for doing this: 1\n2 Queue < Circle >   cq   =   new   Queue < Circle >( 10 );  cq . enqueue ( new   Point ( 1 ,   3 ));   \nwill generate a compile-time error.  Generic typing is a type of polymorphism as well and is also known as  parametric polymorphism .   In Other Languages  Many modern programming languages support generics: C++ (known as  template ), Swift, Kotlin, C#, etc. For dynamically typed languages such as Python, one can already write generic code without regards to the type of the variables, so generic is kinda \"build in\".  In C (the 2011 version, C11), there is a  _Generic  expression, which is not to be confused with generics we are talking about here.   We can use parameterized type anywhere a type is used, including as type argument.  If we want to have a queue of a queue of circles, we can:  1 Queue < Queue < Circle >>   cqq   =   new   Queue <>( 10 );",

We can replace type parameter  T  with  ? , to indicate that  T  can be any type.  This creates a subtype relationship.  For instance,  Queue<Shape>  is a subtype of  Queue <? > ,  Queue<Object>  is a subtype of  Queue <? > .  1 Queue <? >   qc   =   new   Queue < Shape > ();     // OK    Since the wildcard  ?  is not a type, we cannot declare a class like this: 1\n2\n3 class   Bar <?>   { \n     private   ?   x ;  }   \nWe only use  ?  when specifying the type of a variable, field, or parameter.  Wildcards can be bounded.  Java uses the keyword  extends  and  super  to specify the bound.  For instance,  Queue<Circle>  and  Queue<Shape>  are both subtypes of  Queue <?   extends   Shape > , but  Queue<Object>  is not a subtype of  Queue <? > .  To be more general, if  T  is a subtype of  S , then  Queue<T>  is a subtype of  Queue <?   extends   S > .  In other words, the use of  ? extends  is covariant.    The  super  keyword is used to specify the contravariant relationship.\nIf  T  is a subtype of  S , then  Queue<S>  is a subtype of  Queue <?   super   T > .

            "text": "In Java, for backward compatibility, generic typing is implemented with a process called  type erasure .  The type argument is erased during compile time, and the type parameter  T  is replaced with either  Object  (if it is unbounded) or the bound (if it is bounded). For instance,  Queue<Circle>  will be replaced by  Queue  and  T  will be replaced by  Object , just like how Java code is written before generic type is introduced in Java 5.   Queue <?   extends   Shape >  will be replaced with  Queue  and  T  will be replaced with  Shape .  The compiler also inserts type casting and additional methods 2  to preserve the semantics of generic type.  Java's design decision to use type erasure to implement generics has several important implications.    First, unlike other languages, such as C++, Java does not support generics of a primitive type.  We cannot create a  Queue<int> , for instance.  We can only use reference types as type argument (anything that is a subtype of  Object ).  Second, we cannot have code that looks like the following:  1\n2\n3\n4 class   A   { \n   void   foo ( Queue < Circle >   c )   {} \n   void   foo ( Queue < Point >   c )   {}  }    Even though both  foo  above seem like they have different method signatures and is a valid application of method overloading, the compiler actually translates them both to:  1\n2\n3\n4 class   A   { \n   void   foo ( Queue   c )   {} \n   void   foo ( Queue   c )   {}  }    and bummer, we have a compilation error!  Third, using static methods or static fields in generic class becomes trickier.  Consider the example  1\n2\n3\n4\n5 class   Queue < T >   { \n   static   int   x   =   1 ; \n   static   T   y ; \n   static   T   foo ( T   t )   {};  }    Queue<Circle>  and  Queue<Point>  both gets compiled to  Queue .  So they share the same  x , even though you might think  Queue<CIrcle>  and  Queue<Point>  as two different distinct classes.    Further, the next two liens  static T y  and  static T foo(T t) {}  will generate a compilation error.  Since there will only be a copy of  y  shared by both  Queue<Circle>  and  Queue<Point> , the compiler does not know whether to replace  T  with  Circle  or  Point , and will complain.  Fourth, we cannot create an array of parameterized types.  1\n2\n3 Queue < Circle >[]   twoQs   =   new   Queue < Circle >[ 2 ];   // compiler error  twoQs [ 0 ]   =   new   Queue < Circle >();  twoQs [ 1 ]   =   new   Queue < Point >();    After type erasure, we get 1\n2\n3 Queue []   twoQs   =   new   Queue [ 2 ];   // compiler error  twoQs [ 0 ]   =   new   Queue ();  twoQs [ 1 ]   =   new   Queue ();    If Java would have allowed us to create an array of a parameterized type, then we could have added an element of incompatible type  Queue<Point>  into an array of  Queue<Circle>  without raising a run-time error.    Generics in Java is added as an afterthought and to maintain backward compatibility, the compiler has to erase the type parameter during compile type.  During runtime, the type information is no longer available, and this design causes the quirks above.",

First, like a generic class that you have seen,  Collection  is a  generic interface  parameterized with a type parameter  E .  It extends a generic  Iterable<E>  interface (we will get to this later).  The first six methods of  Collection<E>  should be self-explanatory.   add  adds an element into the collection;  contains  checks if a given object is in the collection;   remove  removes a single instance of the given object from the collection;   clear  removes all objects from the collection;   isEmpty()  checks if the collection has no elements or not; and finally,  size  returns the number of elements.  Note that  contains()  relies on the implementation of  equals()  to check if the object exists in the collection or not.  Similarly,  remove()  relies on  equals()  to find the matching objects.  We said earlier that it is useful to override the  equals  methods of  Object  instead of implementing our own  equals , because the overridden  equals()  will be called elsewhere.  This is one of the \"elsewhere\" I mentioned.  The documentation of  contains(o)  mentions that it is guaranteed to return  true  if there exists an element  e  such that  e.equals(o)  or  e == null  (if  o == null ).  Ditto for  remove(o) .   Non-generic Methods  You might notice that, instead of  contains(E e) and  remove(E e) , the  Collection  interface uses  contains(Object o)  and  remove(Object o) .  This little inconsistency, however, is harmless.  For instance, if you have a collection intended for circles only, adding a non-circle could be disastrous.  Trying to remove a non-circle or checking for a non-circle, would just return false.\nMore information can be found on this  StackOverflow  thread.   Java Collection Framework allows classes that implement an interface to throw an  UnsupportedOperationException  if the implementation decides not to implement one of the operations (but still need to have the method in the class).  The method  toArray()  on Line 9 returns an array containing all the elements inside this collection.  The second overloaded  toArray  method takes in an array of generic type  T .  If the collections fit in  a ,  a  is filled and returned.  Else, it allocates a new array of type  T  and returned.  The second  toArray  method is an example of a generic method.  It is the caller responsibility to pass in the right type, otherwise, an  ArrayStoreException  will be thrown.  The next group of methods operates on another collection.   addAll  add all the elements of collection  c  into the current collection;  containsAll  checks if all the elements of collection  c  are contained in the current collection;  removeAll  removes all elements from collection  c , and finally,  retainsAll  remove all elements not in  c .  What is more interesting about the methods is the type of  c .  In  containsAll ,  removeAll , and  retainAll , the collection  c  has the type  Collection <? > .  Recall that  Collection <? >  is a supertype of  Collection<T> , whatever  T  is.  So, we can pass in a  Collection  of any reference type to check for equality.  In this case, we are not adding anything to the collection, so the type of  c  is set to be as general as possible.  In  addAll , however,  c  is declared as  Collection <?   extends   E > .  Since we are adding to the collection, we can only add elements that either has the type  E  or a type that is a subtype of  E .  This constraint is enforced during compile time through the covariance relationship between  Collection <?   extends   E >  and  Collection<E> .   Iterable  The  Iterable<E>  interface provides only a single method,  Iterator<E> iterator() , which returns a generic interface called  Iterator<E>  over the collection.  An  Iterator  is another interface that allows us to go through all the elements in a  Collection<E> .  Useful methods include  hasNext() , which returns if there is a next element in the  Collection<E> ;  next() , which returns the next element (with parameterized type  E ); and  remove() , which removes the last returned element from the  Collection<E> .   So far we have not seen any example code using  Collection .  This is because Java Collection Framework does not provide a class that implements the  Collection<E>  directly.  The documentation recommends that we implement the  Collection<E>  interface 3  if we want a collection of objects that allows duplicates and does not care about the orders.",

Mathematically, a  Collection<E>  is used to represent a bag,  Set<E> , a set, and  List<E> , a sequence.  The  List<E>  interface has additional methods for adding and removing elements.   add(e)  by default would just add to the end of the list.   add(i, e)  inserts  e  to position  i .   get(i)  returns the element at position  i ,  remove(i)  removes the elements at position  i ;  set(i,e)  replace the  i -th element with  e .

The second line adds two strings into the list, each appending them to the list.  After executing Line 3, it would contain the sequence  <\"Cersei\",\"Joffrey\"> .  Line 4 inserts the string  \"Gregor\"  to position 0, moving the rest of the list down by 1 position.  The sequence is now  <\"Gregor\",\"Cersei\",\"Joffrey\"> .  Finally, calling  get(1)  would return the string  \"Cersei\" .  Note that we declare  names  with the interface type  List<String> .  We should always do this to keep our code flexible.  If we want to change our implementation to  LinkedList , we only need to change Line 1 to: 1 List < String >   names   =   new   LinkedList ();",

            "text": "The  List<E>  interface also specifies a  sort  method, with the following specification: 1 default   void   sort ( Comparator <?   super   E >   c )    List<E>  is an example of an interface with default method.  The keyword  default  indicates that the interface  List<E>  comes with a default  sort  implementation, so a class that implements the interface needs not implement it again unless the class wants to override the method.  This method specification is also interesting and worth looking closer.  It takes in an object  c  with generic interface  Comparator <?   super   E > .  The  Comparator  interface allows us to specify how to compare two elements, by implementing a  compare()  method.   compare(o1,o2)  should return 0 if the two elements are equals, a negative integer if o1 is \"less than\" o2, and a positive integer otherwise.  Let's write  Comparator  class 4 :  1\n2\n3\n4\n5 class   NameComparator   implements   Comparator < String >   { \n     public   int   compare ( String   s1 ,   String   s2 )   { \n         return   s1 . compareTo ( s2 ); \n     }  }    In the above, we use the  compareTo  method provided by the  String  class to do the comparison.  With the above, we can now sort the  names :  1 names . sort ( new   NameComparator ());    This would result in the sequence being changed to  <\"Cersei\",\"Gregor\",\"Joffrey\"> .  We can easily change how we want to sort the names, for instance, to 1\n2\n3\n4\n5 class   NameComparator   implements   Comparator < String >   { \n     public   int   compare ( String   s1 ,   String   s2 )   { \n         return   s1 . length ()   -   s2 . length (); \n     }  }   \nif we want to sort by the length of the names.  One last thing to note about the method  sort  is that it takes in  Comparator <?   super   E >  that is contravariant.  Recall that  Comparator<Object>  is a subtype of  Comparator <?   super   E > , so we can pass in more general  Comparator  object to  sort  (e.g., a class that implements  Comprator<Object>",

A map allows us to store a (unique key, value) pair into the collection, and retrieve the value later by looking up the key.  The  Map<K,V>  interface is again generic, but this time, has two type parameters,  K  for the type of the key, and  V  for the type of the value.  These parameters make the  Map  interface flexible -- we can use any type as the key and value.

For the few classes we have seen:   Use  HashMap  if you want to keep a (key, value) pair for lookup later.  Use  HashSet  if you have a collection of elements with no duplicates and order is not important.  Use  ArrayList  if you have a collection of elements with possible duplicates and order is important, and retrieving a specific location is more important than removing elements from the list.  Use  LinkedList  if you have a collection of elements with possibly duplicates and order is important, retriving a specific location is less important than removing elements from the list.   You should understand the reasons above after CS2040.  Further, if you want to check if a given object is contained in the list, then  ArrayList  and  LinkedList  are not good candidates.   HashSet , on the other hand, can quickly check if an item is already contained in the set.  There is, unfortunately, no standard collection class that supports fast  contain  and allow duplicates.",

What are the methods that  B  needs to implement?    For each of the statement below, indicate if it is a valid statement (no compilation error). Explain why in one sentence.   List <? >   list   =   new   ArrayList < String > ();  List <?   super   Integer >   list   =   new   List < Object > ();  List <?   extends   Object >   list   =   new   LinkedList < Object > ();  List <?   super   Integer >   list   =   new   LinkedList <> ();     Consider a generic class  A<T>  with a type parameter  T  and a constructor with no argument.  Which of the following statements are valid (i.e., no compilation error) ways of creating a new object of type A? We still consider the statement as valid if the Java compiler produces a warning.   new A<int>();  new A<>();  new A();     In this question, we will explore the more strange behavior of  Integer  class.  Remember that  ==  compares only references: whether the two references are pointing to the same object or not.   The  equals  method has been overridden to compare if the values are the same or not.  Try the following in  jshell :  1\n2\n3 Integer   x   =   1 ;  Integer   y   =   1 ;  x   ==   y ;    What do you expect the comparison  ==  to return?  What did it return?  Now try:  1\n2\n3 Integer   x   =   1000 ;  Integer   y   =   1000 ;  x   ==   y ;    What do you expect it to return?  What did it return?  Look up on the Internet (e.g., StackOverflow) on why this happens.    The moral of the story here is to always use  equals  to compare two reference variables.    Consider a method declared as  int foo(double x)  Which of the following statements will NOT result in a compilation error:   int cs = foo(2030);  double cs = foo(2.030);  int cs = foo(new Double(2.030));  Integer cs = foo(new Double(2.030));     In this question, we will explore the behavior of  ArrayList  class and autoboxing/unboxing.  Will the following code compile?  If so, what will be printed?

For  vim  users, you can add the following line in your  ~/.vimrc  file: 1 set expandtab  \nSo that when you press   it is expanded to whitespace.  Most other source code editors have similar configuration.      Exactly one blank line after import statements and exactly one top-level (i.e., non-nested) class.    Each top-level class resides in a source file of its own.    When a class has overladed methods (e.g., multiple constructors or methods of the same name), they appear sequentially with no other code in between.    Braces are always used (even if the body is empty or contains a single statement}    Use \"Egyptian brackets\":    Opening brace have no line break before; but has line break after  Closing brace has a line break before; and has a line break after (except when there is  else  or comma following a closing brace.   Example: 1\n2\n3     if   ( x   ==   0 )   { \n      x ++; \n    }     is good.  1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8     if   ( x   ==   0 )   {   x ++;   } \n    if   ( x   ==   0 )  \n    { \n      x ++; \n    } \n    if   ( x   ==   0 )  \n    { \n      x ++;   }    are not good.

Each statement is followed by a line break, no matter how short the statement is.  1    x ++;   i ++;   \nis bad. 1\n2    x ++;  \n   i ++;   \nis good.    Each line is limited to 80 characters in length.  You can break a long\nline into multiple lines to enhance readability, this is called  line wrapping .  When you do so, each continuation line is indented at least 4 spaces from the original line.  1 System . out . println ( \"Daenerys of the House Targaryen, the First of Her Name, The Unburnt, Queen of the Andals, the Rhoynar and the First Men, Queen of Meereen, Khaleesi of the Great Grass Sea, Protector of the Realm, Lady Regnant of the Seven Kingdoms, Breaker of Chains and Mother of Dragon\" );    is bad.  1\n2\n3\n4\n5 System . out . println ( \"Daenerys of the House Targaryen, the First of\"   +  \" Her Name, The Unburnt, Queen of the Andals, the Rhoynar and the\"   +  \" First Men, Queen of Meereen, Khaleesi of the Great Grass Sea, P\"   +  \"rotector of the Realm, Lady Regnant of the Seven Kingdoms, Break\"   +  \"er of Chains and Mother of Dragon\" );    is also bad.  1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6 System . out . println ( \"Daenerys of the House Targaryen,\"   +  \n     \"the First of Her Name, The Unburnt, Queen of the Andals,\"   + \n     \"the Rhoynar and the First Men, Queen of Meereen,\"   + \n     \"Khaleesi of the Great Grass Sea, Protector of the Realm,\"   + \n     \"Lady Regnant of the Seven Kingdoms, Breaker of Chains and\"   + \n     \"Mother of Dragon\" );   \nis ok.     80 vs 100  While we prefer lines to be limited to 80, we are OK if the length is up to 100.  Any longer, however, will be frowned upon.     There should be a blank line between constructors, methods, nested classes and static initializers.  Blank lines can be used between fields to create logical groupings.

The \nJava SE 8 API\n that you have seen are generated from \njavadoc\n.\n\n\nHow to comment for javadoc\n\n\njavadoc\n distinguishes between normal comments and comments meant for \njavadoc\n by how we \"fence\" the comments.  A \njavadoc\n comments always starts with \n/**\n (not the double asterisks) and ends with \n*/\n and are always placed \nimmediately\n before a class, an interface, a constructor, a method, or field declaration.\n\n\nExample:\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n/** \n\n\n * Encapsulates a circle on a 2D plane.

The first time you ever connect to \ncs2030-i.comp.nus.edu.sg\n, you will be warned that you are connecting to a previously unknown host.  Say \nyes\n, and you will be prompted with your SoC UNIX password.\n\n\nFor Windows 7 or 8 (or Windows 10 without Linux Subsystem)\n\n\nThe desktop computers in Programming Lab 6 (PL6) runs Windows 7.  If you are using these computers, or your own computers with older versions of Windows, you need to use programs like \nPuTTY\n to access the VM.\n\n\nAccessing \ncs2030-i\n from Outside SoC\n\n\nTHe VM can only be accessed from within the School of Computing networks.  If you want to access it from outside, there are two ways\n\n\nUsing SoC VPN\n\n\nOne way is to setup a Virtual Private Network (VPN) (See \ninstruction here\n).  The staff at \nhelpdesk@comp.nus.edu.sg\n or the IT helpdesk in COM1, Level 1, will be able to help with you setting up if needed.\n\n\nTunneling through Sunfire\n\n\nThe alternative is to use ssh tunnels.\n\n\nSoC's Sunfire (\nsunfire.comp.nus.edu.sg\n) is configured to allow your connection if it's originating from a local telco. (See \nmore details here\n.)  Since \nsunfire\n is situated within the School of Computing network, \nsunfire\n is able to access the VM.  This opens the possibility of connecting from your device (using an Internet connection from a local telco) to \nsunfire\n, and then from \nsunfire\n to the VM.\n\n\nThere are two ways to achieve this, and in both ways it appears to the CS2030 VM that Sunfire is the client.\n\n\nSSH Using Sunfire's Terminal\n\n\nConnect to Sunfire at \nsunfire.comp.nus.edu.sg\n via your favourite SSH client.  After logging in, run the command \nssh cs2030-i\n to connect to the CS2030 VM.  This effectively starts an SSH session to the VM from within your existing SSH session to Sunfire.  Refer to instructions below on how to connect via SSH.\n\n\nSSH Port Forwarding\n\n\nSSH has built-in support for local and remote port forwarding, and local port forwarding can be used to commect to the CS2030 VM.  Local port forwarding means that a port of the SSH client (your machine) is forwarded to the SSH server (\nsunfire\n), which opens a connection to a preset destination server (\ncs2030-i\n).  This method causes the CS2030 VM to seem as if it is hosted on a local port, e.g. \nlocalhost\n:\n2030\n, allowing you to use your favourite SCP program (e.g. \nFileZilla\n) to access the VM.\n\n\nTo use local port forwarding (from local port \n2030\n), connect to \nsunfire\n using \n\n1\nssh -L 2030:cs2030-i.comp.nus.edu.sg:22 <username>@sunfire.comp.nus.edu.sg\n\n\n\n\nThis command opens an SSH tunnel from port \n2030\n of your machine to port \n22\n (the default SSH port) of \ncs2030-i.comp.nus.edu.sg\n via \nsunfire\n.  After successful login, open a separate SSH (or SCP) connection from your machine to \nlocalhost\n:\n2030\n to access the VM.\n\n\nPuTTY\n supports SSH port forwarding, so this setup can also be used on Windows.\n\n\nBasic UNIX Commands\n\n\nOnce you logged into the VM, you will be prompted to enter a command with a prompt that looks like this:\n\n1\nhappytan@cs2030-i:~[xxx]$\n\n\n\n\nThis interface is provided by a UNIX shell -- not unlike \njshell\n, this shell sits in a loop and wait for users to enter a command, then it interprets and executes the command.  There are many versions of shells, the default shell for our VM is \nbash\n1\n.\n\n\nThe following is adapted for CS2030 from \nthe instructions created by Aaron Tan\n. Bugs are mine.\n  \n\n\nThe power of UNIX stems from the many commands it offers. The following are a few commonly used commands. This list is by no means exhaustive and you are urged to explore on your own. Note that UNIX commands are case-sensitive.\n\n\nIn the examples below, bold words are commands which you are expected to enter. All commands are to be entered after the UNIX (local or \nsunfire\n or \ncs2030-i\n) prompt of the form\n\n\n1\nhappytan@cs2030-i:~[xxx]$\n\n\n\n\n\n\n~\n indicates that you are currently in your home directory, \nxxx\n is a number indicating the number of commands that have been entered.  The following examples assumes that user \nhappytan\n is logged into cs2030-i; however you can do it on your local UNIX platform too.\n\n\nIt might be good to understand the directory structure in UNIX, a multi-user system. The directory tree is shown below:\n\n\n\n\nEach user has his/her own home directory, which is where he/she will be automatically placed when he/she logs into the system. The above figure shows where the home directory of user \nhappytan\n resides in the directory tree. The user \nhappytan\n may create files or directories in his/her home directory, but not elsewhere unless permission is given.\n\n\nDirectory commands\n\n\n\n\n\n\npwd\n: Print current Working Directory to show you which directory you are currently in\n\n1\n2\nhappytan@cs2030-i:~[xxx]$ pwd\n/home/h/happytan\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nls\n: LiSt files in your current directory\n\n1\n2\nhappytan@cs2030-i:~[xxx]$ ls\nhappytan@cs2030-i:~[xxx]$\n\n\n\n\n   If you do not have any regular files in your home directory, as you should when you first login, you should immediately return to the shell prompt.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRule of Silence\nUNIX follows the \nrule of silence\n: programs should not print unnecessary output, to allow other programs and users to easily parse the output from one program.  So, if \nls\n has nothing to list, it will list nothing (as oppose to, say, printing \"This is an empty directory.\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmkdir\n: MaKe a subDIRectory in current directory\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\nhappytan@cs2030-i:~[xxx]$ mkdir lab01\nhappytan@cs2030-i:~[xxx]$ ls\nlab01\nhappytan@cs2030-i:~[xxx]$ ls -F\nlab01/\n\n\n\n\nHere, you create a directory called \nlab01\n.  Now, when you \nls\n, you can see the directory listed.\nYou may also use \nls -F\n for more information (\n-F\n is one of the many \noptions\n/\nflags\n available for the \nls\n command. To see a complete list of the options, refer to the man pages, i.e., \nman ls\n.)\n\n\nThe slash \n/\n beside the filename tells you that the file is a directory (aka folder in Windows lingo). A normal file does not have a slash beside its name when \"ls -F\" is used.\n\n\nYou may also use the \nls -l\n command (hyphen el, not hyphen one) to display almost all the file information, include the size of the file and the date of modification.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCommand history\n\n\nUNIX maintains a history of your previously executed UNIX commands, and you may use the up and down arrows to go through it. Press the up arrow until you find a previously executed UNIX command. You may then press Enter to execute it, or edit the command before executing it. This is handy when you need to repeatedly executed a long UNIX command.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncd\n: Change Directory from current directory to another\n\n1\n2\nhappytan@cs2030-i:~[xxx]$ cd lab01\nhappytan@cs2030-i:~/lab01[xxx]$\n\n\n\n\nNote that the prompt changes to \n~/lab01\n to indicate that you are now in the \nlab01\n directory below your \nHOME\n directory.\n\n\nEntering \ncd\n alone brings you back to your \nHOME\n directory, i.e.,. the directory in which you started with when you first logged into the system.\n\n1\n2\nhappytan@cs2030-i:~/lab01[xxx]$ cd\nhappytan@cs2030-i:~[xxx]$\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nrmdir\n:  to ReMove a subDIRectory in current directory -- note that a directory must be empty before it can be removed.\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\nhappytan@cs2030-i:~[xxx]$ rmdir lab01\nhappytan@cs2030-i:~[xxx]$ ls -F\nhappytan@cs2030-i:~[xxx]$ mkdir lab01\nhappytan@cs2030-i:~[xxx]$ ls -F\nlab01/\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFile commands\n\n\n\n\ncp\n:  CoPy files\n\n1\n2\n3\nhappytan@cs2030-i:~/lab01[xxx]$ cp ~cs2030/lab01/Circle.java .\nhappytan@cs2030-i:~/lab01[xxx]$ ls\nCircle.java\n\n\n\n\nThe command above copy the files Circle.java from the HOME of user \ncs2030\n, under directory \nlab01\n, to the current directory.\n\n\n\n\nIf you want to copy the whole directory, use \n-r\n flag, where \nr\n stands for recursive copy.\n\n\n1\nhappytan@cs2030-i:~/lab01[xxx]$ cp -r ~cs2030/lab01 .\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe directory \nlab01\n and everything under it will be copied.\n\n\n\n\nmv\n: MoVe files from one directory to another; can also be used to rename files.\n\n1\n2\n3\nhappytan@cs2030-i:~/lab01[xxx]$ mv Circle.java Test.java\nhappytan@cs2030-i:~/lab01[xxx]$ ls\nTest.java\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFilename completion\n\n\nIf you have a very long file name, you may use UNIX's filename completion feature to reduce typing. For instance, you may type:\n\n1\nhappytan@cs2030-i:~/lab01[xxx]$ mv C\n\n\n\n\nand press the tab key, and UNIX will complete the filename for you if there is only one filename with the prefix \"C\". Otherwise, it will fill up the filename up to point where you need to type in more characters for disambiguation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nrm\n: ReMove files. Be careful with this command -- files deleted cannot be restored (unless they have been backed up during the normal backup cycle).\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\nhappytan@cs2030-i:~/lab01[xxx]$ rm Test.java\nrm: remove 'Test.java'? y\nhappytan@cs2030-i:~/lab01[xxx]$ ls\nhappytan@cs2030-i:~/lab01[xxx]$\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCommand to display text files\n\n\n\n\ncat\n: to string together or display (CATenate) the contents of files onto the screen\n\n1\nhappytan@cs2030-i:~/lab01[xxx]$ cat Circle.java\n\n\n\n\n\nless\n - variant of \ncat\n (includes features to read each page leisurely)\n\n1\nhappytan@cs2030-i:~/lab01[xxx]$ less Circle.java\n\n\n\n\nIn \nless\n, use \n<space>\n to move down one page, \nb\n to move Back up one page, and \nq\n to Quit from \"less\".\n\n\n\n\nAn online help facility is available in UNIX via the \nman\n command (\nman\n stands for MANual). To look for more information about any UNIX command, for example, \nls\n, type \nman ls\n. Type \nman man\n and refer to Man Pages to find out more about the facility. To exit \nman\n, press \nq\n.\n\n\nNow that you are familiar with how the UNIX shell works, I won't show the command prompt any more in the rest of this article.\n\n\nUNIX File Permission\n\n\nIt is important to guide our files properly on a multi-user system where users share the same file system.  UNIX has a simple mechanism to for ensuring that: every file and directory has nine bits of access permission, corresponds to three access operations, read (\nr\n), write (\nw\n), and execute (\nx\n), for four classes of users, the user who owns of the file (\nu\n), users in the same group as the owner (\ng\n), all other users (\no\n), and all users (\na\n) (union of all three classes before)\n\n\nWhen you run \nls -l\n, you will see the permission encoded as strings that look like \n-rw-------\n or \ndrwx--x--x\n besides other file information.   \n\n\n\n\nThe first character indicates if the file is a directory (\nd\n) or not (\n-\n).  \n\n\nThe next three characters are the permission for the owner.  \nrwx\n means that the owner can do all three: reading, writing, and executing, \nrw-\n means that the owner can read and write, but cannot execute.\n\n\nThe next three characters are the permission for the users in the same group.\n\n\nThe last three characters are the permission for the users in the other groups.\n\n\n\n\nTo change permission, we use the \nchmod\n command.  Let's say that we want to remove the read and write permission from all other users in the group.  You can run:\n\n1\nchmod g-rw <file>\n\n\n\n\n\nwhere \n<file>\n is the name of the file whose permission you want to change.  This would change the permission from \n-rw-rw-rw-\n to \n-rw----rw-\n, or from \n-rwxr--r--\n to \n-rwx---r--\n.\n\n\nTo add executable permission to everyone, you can run:\n\n1\nchmod a+x <file>\n\n\n\n\n\nThis would change the permission from \n-rw-rw-rw-\n to \n-rwx--xrwx\n, or from \n-rwxr--r--\n to \n-rwx--xr-x\n, and so on.  You get the idea.\n\n\nAnother way to change the permission is set the permission directly, instead of adding with \n+\n and removing with \n-\n.  To do this, one convenient way is to treat the permission for each class of user as a 3-bit binary number between 0 to 7.  So, \nrwx\n is 7, \nrw-\n is 6, \n-w-\n is 2, \n---\n is 0, etc.  \n\n\nTo set the permission of a file to \n-r--r--r--\n (readable by everyone), run:\n\n1\nchmod 444 <file>\n\n\n\n\n\nTo set the permission to \n-rw-------\n, run:\n\n1\nchmod 600 <file>\n\n\n\n\n\nand so on.\n\n\nIt is important to ensure that your code is not readable and writable by other students, especially for graded lab exercises.\n\n\nSecure Copy (\nscp\n)\n\n\nSecure copy, or \nscp\n, is one way to transfer files from your local computer to \ncs2030-i\n.  If you choose not to use \nemacs\n or \nvim\n2\n and write your code on \ncs2030-i\n, you can write your code on your local computer, and transfer them.  Let's say that you are in the directory with a bunch of java files you want to transfer, and you want them transferred into directory \ntest\n that you have created, do the following:\n\n\n1\nscp *.java happytan@cs2030-i:~/test\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\nIf you have files with the same name in the remote directory, the files will be overwritten without warning.  I have lost my code a few times due to \nscp\n.  \n\n\n\n\nThe expression \n*.java\n is a regular expression that means all files with filename ending with \n.java\n.  You can copy specific files as well.  For instance,\n\n\n1\nscp Circle.java Point.java happytan@cs2030-i:~/test\n\n\n\n\n\n\nscp\n supports \n-r\n (recursive copy) as well.\n\n\nSetting up SSH Keys\n\n\nOnce you are comfortable with UNIX, you can set up a pair of public/private keys for authentication.  \n\n\nYou can use\n\n1\nssh-keygen -t rsa\n\n\n\n\n\nto generate a pair of keys on your local computer.  Keep the private key \nid_rsa\n on your local machine in the hidden \n~/.ssh\n directory, and copy the public key \nid_rsa.pub\n to your home directory on VM \ncs2030-i\n.  On \ncs2030-i\n, run\n\n1\ncat id_rsa.pub >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys\n\n\n\n\n\nMake sure that the permission for \n.ssh\n both on local machine and on VM is set to \n700\n and the files \nid_rsa\n on local machine and \nauthorized_keys\n on remote machine is set to \n600\n.  Once setup, you need not enter your password every time you run \nssh\n or \nscp\n.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI run \nfish\n on my macOS, as you might have noticed during the in-class demos.  You can use any shell you like, if you know what you are doing.  Otherwise, \nbash\n is a popular one.\u00a0\n\u21a9\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMy personal opinion is that, you should really master one of these two time-tested source code editor if you want a career in software development.\u00a0\n\u21a9",

To see a complete list of the options, refer to the man pages, i.e.,  man ls .)  The slash  /  beside the filename tells you that the file is a directory (aka folder in Windows lingo). A normal file does not have a slash beside its name when \"ls -F\" is used.  You may also use the  ls -l  command (hyphen el, not hyphen one) to display almost all the file information, include the size of the file and the date of modification.     Command history  UNIX maintains a history of your previously executed UNIX commands, and you may use the up and down arrows to go through it. Press the up arrow until you find a previously executed UNIX command. You may then press Enter to execute it, or edit the command before executing it.

            "text": "It is important to guide our files properly on a multi-user system where users share the same file system.  UNIX has a simple mechanism to for ensuring that: every file and directory has nine bits of access permission, corresponds to three access operations, read ( r ), write ( w ), and execute ( x ), for four classes of users, the user who owns of the file ( u ), users in the same group as the owner ( g ), all other users ( o ), and all users ( a ) (union of all three classes before)  When you run  ls -l , you will see the permission encoded as strings that look like  -rw-------  or  drwx--x--x  besides other file information.      The first character indicates if the file is a directory ( d ) or not ( - ).    The next three characters are the permission for the owner.   rwx  means that the owner can do all three: reading, writing, and executing,  rw-  means that the owner can read and write, but cannot execute.  The next three characters are the permission for the users in the same group.  The last three characters are the permission for the users in the other groups.   To change permission, we use the  chmod  command.  Let's say that we want to remove the read and write permission from all other users in the group.  You can run: 1 chmod g-rw <file>   where  <file>  is the name of the file whose permission you want to change.  This would change the permission from  -rw-rw-rw-  to  -rw----rw- , or from  -rwxr--r--  to  -rwx---r-- .  To add executable permission to everyone, you can run: 1 chmod a+x <file>   This would change the permission from  -rw-rw-rw-  to  -rwx--xrwx , or from  -rwxr--r--  to  -rwx--xr-x , and so on.  You get the idea.  Another way to change the permission is set the permission directly, instead of adding with  +  and removing with  - .  To do this, one convenient way is to treat the permission for each class of user as a 3-bit binary number between 0 to 7.  So,  rwx  is 7,  rw-  is 6,  -w-  is 2,  ---  is 0, etc.    To set the permission of a file to  -r--r--r--  (readable by everyone), run: 1 chmod 444 <file>   To set the permission to  -rw------- , run: 1 chmod 600 <file>   and so on.  It is important to ensure that your code is not readable and writable by other students, especially for graded lab exercises.",

            "text": "Vim Tips\n\n\nI collected below some tips on \nvim\n that I find helpful.\n\n\nConfiguration\n\n\nYou can configure your \nvim\n by putting your configuration options and scripts in the \n~/.vimrc\n file (a hidden file named \n.vimrc\n in your home directory).  This file will be loaded whenever you starts \nvim\n.\n\n\nHelp\n\n\nIn \nvim,\n the command \n:help <topic>\n shows help about a particular topic in \nvim\n.  Example, \n:help backup\n.\n\n\nBackup Files\n\n\nYou can ask \nvim\n to automatically backup files that you edit.  This has been a life saver for me in multiple  occasions.\n\n\nIn your \n~/.vimrc\n file, \n\n\n1\nset backup=on\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwill cause a copy of your file to be save with suffix \n~\n appended to its name everytime you save.\n\n\nI prefer not to clutter my working directory, so I set\n\n\n1\nset backupdir=~/.backup\n\n\n\n\n\n\nand create a directory named \n~/.backup\n to store my backup files.\n\n\nThe settings above are the default in your \ncs2030-i\n account.  So if you made changes to a file that you regreted on \ncs2030-i\n, or if accidentally deleted a file, you can check under \n~/.backup\n to see if the backup can save you.\n\n\nUndo\n\n\nSince we are on the topic of correcting mistakes, \nu\n in command mode undo your changes.  Prefix it with a number \n\\(n\\)\n to undo \n\\(n\\)\n times.  If you regreted your undo, \n<CTRL-R>\n will redo.\n\n\nSyntax Highlighting\n\n\nIf for some reasons, syntax highlighting is not on by default, add this to your \n~/.vimrc\n:\n\n\n1\nsyntax on\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRuler and Numbers\n\n\nIf you prefer to show the line number you are on and the column number you are on, adding the commands to \n~/.vimrc\n\n\n1\nset ruler\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwill display the line number and the column number on the lower right corner.  \n\n\nYou can also add\n\n1\nset number\n\n\n\n\n\nto label each line with a line number.\n\n\nJumping to a Line\n\n\nIf the compiler tells you there is an error on Line \n\\(x\\)\n, you can issue \n:<x>\n to jump to Line \n\\(x\\)\n.  For instance, \n:40\n will go to Line 40.\n\n\nNavigation\n\n\n\n\nw\n   jump to the beginning of the next word\n\n\nb\n   jump to the beginning of the previous word (reverse of \nw\n)\n\n\ne\n   jump to the end of the word (or next word when pressed again)\n\n\nf\n + char: search forward in the line and sit on the next matching char\n\n\nt\n + char:  search forward in the line and sit on one space before the matching char\n\n\n jump forward half page\n\n\n jump backward half page\n\n\n$\n jump to end of line\n\n\n0\n jump to the beginning of the line\n\n\n%\n jump between matching parentheses\n\n\n\n\nNavigation + Editing\n\n\nvim\n is powerful because you can combine \noperations\n with \nnavigation\n.  For instance \nc\n to change, \nd\n to delete, \ny\n to yank (copy).  Since \nw\n is the navigation command to move over the current word, combining them we get:\n\n\n\n\ncw\n change the current word (delete the current word and enter insert mode)\n\n\ndw\n delete the current word\n\n\nyw\n yank the current word (copy word into buffer)\n\n\n\n\nCan you guess what \ndf)\n, \ndt)\n, \nc$\n, \ny0\n do?\n\n\nIf you repeat the operation \nc\n, \nd\n, and \ny\n, it applies to the whole line, so:\n\n\n\n\ncc\n change the whole line\n\n\ndd\n delete the whole line\n\n\nyy\n yank the whole line\n\n\n\n\nYou can add a number before an operation to specify how many times you want to repeat an operation.  So \n5dd\n deletes 5 lines, \n5dw\n deletes 5 words, etc.\n\n\nSee the article \nOperator, the True Power of \nVim\n for more details.\n\n\nOther Editing Operations\n\n\n\n\nA\n jump to end of line and enter insert mode\n\n\no\n open next line and enter insert mode\n\n\nO\n open previous line and enter insert mode\n\n\n\n\nSearch and Replace in \nvim\n\n\n1\n:%s/oldWord/newWord/gc \n\n\n\n\n\n\n:\n enters the command mode.  \n%\n means apply to the whole document, \ns\n means substitute, \ng\n means global (otherwise, only the first occurance of each line is replaced). \nc\n is optional -- adding it cause \nvim\n to confirm with you before each replacement  \n\n\nCommenting blocks of code\n\n\nSometimes we need to comment out a whole block of code in Java for testing purposes. There are several ways to do it in \nvim\n:\n\n\n\n\nPlace the cursor on the first line of the block of code you want to comment.\n\n\n0\n to jump to the beginning of the line\n\n\nV\n enter visual mode\n\n\nUse arrow key to select the block of code you want to comment. \n\n\nI\n to insert at the beginning of the line (here, since we already selected the block, we will insert at the beginning of every selected)\n\n\n//\n to insert the Java comment character (you will see it inserted in the current line, but don't worry)\n\n\n to escape from the visual code.\n\n\n\n\nTo uncomment, \n\n\n\n\nPlace the cursor on the first line of the block of code you want to comment.\n\n\n0\n to jump to the beginning of the line\n\n\n<CTRL-v>\n enter block visual mode\n\n\nUse arrow key to select the columns of text containing \n//\n\n\nx\n to delete them\n\n\n\n\nShell Command\n\n\nIf you need to issue a shell command quickly, you don't have to exit \nvim\n, run the command, and launch \nvim\n again.  You can use \n!\n, \n\n\n1\n:!<command>\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwill issue the command to shell.  E.g.,\n\n\n1\n:!ls\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can use this to compile your current file, without exiting \nvim\n.\n\n\n1\n:!javac %\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbbreviation\n\n\nYou can use the command \nab\n to abbreviate frequently typed commands.  E.g., in your \n~/.vimrc\n, \n\n\n1\nab Sop System.out.println(\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow, when you type \nSop\n, it will be expanded into \nSystem.out.println(\"\n\n\nAuto-Completion\n\n\nYou can \n<CTRL-P>\n to auto-complete.  By default, the auto-complete dictionary is based on text in your current editing buffers.  This is a very useful keystroke saver for long function and variable names.\n\n\nAuto-Indent the Whole File\n\n\nYou can \ngg=G\n in command mode to auto-indent the whole file.  \ngg\n is the command to go to the beginning of the file.  \n=\n is the command to indent.  \nG\n is the command to go to the end of the file.\n\n\nSwapping Lines\n\n\nSometimes you want to swap the order of two lines of code, in command mode, \nddp\n will do the trick.  \ndd\n deletes the current line, \np\n paste it after the current line, in effect swapping the order of the two lines.\n\n\nGoto File\n\n\nPlace your cursor on the name of a class (e.g., \nEvent\n), then in command mode, issue the \ngf\n command (goto file).  \nvim\n will open \nEvent.java\n.  You can set the \npath\n to load files from directories other than the current directory.   \"Ctrl-^\" will get out and back to the previous file.\n\n\nSyntax and Style Checker\n\n\nI use \nsyntastic\n to check for style and syntax whenever I save a file.  \nsyntastic\n is a \nvim\n plugin. \n\n\nMy \n.vimrc\n configuration file contains the following:\n\n\n 1\n 2\n 3\n 4\n 5\n 6\n 7\n 8\n 9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n\"For syntastic\nset laststatus=2\nset statusline+=%#warningmsg#\nset statusline+=%{SyntasticStatuslineFlag()}\nset statusline+=%*\n\nlet g:syntastic_always_populate_loc_list = 1\nlet g:syntastic_auto_loc_list = 1\nlet g:syntastic_check_on_open = 1\nlet g:syntastic_check_on_wq = 0\nlet g:syntastic_java_checkers = [ \"checkstyle\", \"javac\" ]\nlet g:syntastic_java_checkstyle_classpath = \"~cs2030/bin/checkstyle-8.2-all.jar\"\nlet g:syntastic_java_checkstyle_conf_file = \"~cs2030/bin/cs2030_checks.xml\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe last two lines refer to \ncheckstyle\n tool and its configuration file available from \n~cs2030/bin\n on the host \ncs2030-i.comp.nus.edu.sg\n.\n\n\nSplitting \nvim\n's Viewport\n\n\n\n\n:sp file.java\n splits the \nvim\n window horizontally\n\n\n:vsp file.java\n splits the \nvim\n window vertically\n\n\nCtrl-w Ctrl-w\n moves between the different \nvim\n viewports",
