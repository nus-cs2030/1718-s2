## What Exactly is a _Program_?

A program is a set of instructions we issue to computers to manipulate data.  A programming language is a formal language that helps programmers specify precisely what are the instructions we issue to computers, using code that are often made up of keywords, symbols, and names.  Computers execute the instructions in their _processing units_, and store the instructions and data in their _memory_[^1].  The processing units recognize the instructions based on the specific patterns of bits and manipulate data as a sequence of bits.  A programming language, however, is written at a higher level of _abstraction_ (i.e., at a higher conceptual level), so that as a programmer, we only need to write a few lines of code to give complex instructions to the computer.  A _compiler_ or _interpreter_ is responsible for translating these programs written in high level language to _assembly code_ or _machine code_, i.e., bit patterns that the processing units can understand.

[^1]: Often, the instructions and data are stored in different regions of the memory.

There are thousands of programming languages in existence.  _C_ is one of the languages that is a _low-level language_ -- i.e., it provides a very thin layer of abstractions on top of machine code.  On the other hand, languages such as _Python_ and _JavaScript_ are high-level languages.  As an example, in C, you can directly manage memory allocation.  In JavaScript and Python, you cannot.

## Abstraction: Variable and Type
One of the important abstractions that is provided by a programming language is _variable_.  Data are stored in some location in the computer memory.  But we should not be referring to the memory location all the time.  First, referring to something like `0xFA49130E` is not user-friendly; Second, the location may change.  A _variable_ is an abstraction that allows us to give a user-friendly name to a piece of data in memory.  We use the _variable name_ whenever we want to access the _value_ in that location, and _pointer to the variable_ or _reference to the variable_ whenever we want to refer to the address of the location.

Let's think a bit more about how a sequence of bits is abstracted as data in a programming language.  At the machine level, these bits are just, well, bits.  We give the bits a _semantic_ at the program level, e.g., we want to interpret the sequence of bits as numbers, letters, etc.  E.g., the number (integer, to be exact) `65` and the letter `A` all share the same sequence of bits `0100 0001` but are interpreted differently and possibly manipulated differently.  

The _type_ of a variable tells the compiler or the interpreter how to interpret the variable and how to manipulate the variable.  

For instance, supposed that in Python, if you have two variables `x` and `y` storing the values `4` and `5` respectively, if you `print x + y`, you would get `45` if `x` and `y` are strings; you would get `9` if `x` and `y` are integers; you would get an error if `4` is an integer and `5` is a string.  

In the last instance above, you see that assigning a type to each variable helps to keep the program meaningful, as the operation `+` is not defined over an integer and a string in Python[^2].

[^2]: Javascript would happily convert `4` into a string for you, and return `45`.

Python is a _dynamically typed_ language.  The same variable can hold values of different types, and checking if the right type is used is done during the execution of the program.  Note that, the type is associated with the _values_, and the type of the variable changes depending on the value it holds.

C, on the other hand, is a _statically typed_ language.  We need to _declare_ every variable we use in the program and specify its type.  A variable can only hold values of the same type as the type of the variable, so we can't assign, for instance, a string to a variable of type `int`.  We check if the right type is used during the compilation of the program.

```C
int x = 4; // ok
int y = "5"; // error
```

By annotating each variable with its type, the C compiler also knows how much memory space is needed to store a variable.  

## Abstraction: Functions

Another important abstraction provided by a programming language is _function_ (or _procedure_).  This abstraction allows programmers to group a set of instructions and give it a name.  The named set of instructions may take one or more variables as input parameters, and return one or more values.   

Like all other abstractions, defining functions allow us to think at a higher conceptual level.  By composing functions at increasingly higher level of abstractions, we can build programs with increasing level of complexity.

Defining functions allow us to abstract away the implementation details from the caller.  Once a function is defined, we can change the way the function is implemented without affecting the code that calls the function, as long as the semantic and the _interface_ of the function remains the same.

Function, therefore, is a critical mechanism for achieving _separation of concerns_ in a program.  We separate the concerns about how a particular function is implemented, from the concerns about how the function is used to perform a higher-level task.

Defining functions also allow us to _reuse_ code.  We do not have to repeatedly write the same chunk of code if we group the sequence of code into a function -- then we just need to call the function to invoke this sequence of code every time we need it.  If this chunk of code is properly written and debugged, then we can be pretty sure that everywhere the function is invoked, the code is correct[^3].

[^3]: assuming the parameters are passed correctly.

C is a _procedural language_.  A C program consists of functions, with the `main()` function serves as the entry point to the program.  Since C is a statically typed language, a C function has a return type, and each  function parameter (or _argument_) has a type as well.  (Note that this statement does not mean that a C function must return a _value_.  If the function does not return a value, we define its return type as `void`.)

Recall that the bits representing the instructions are also stored in the computer memory in an area separated from the data.  The instructions that belong to the same function are stored in adjacent memory locations.  Just like we can refer to a variable using its memory address through its _reference_ (or _pointer_), we can refer to a function using the memory address of the entry point to the function.

## Abstraction: Composite Data Type

Just like functions allow programmers to group instructions, give it a name, and refer to it later, a _composite data type_ allows programmers to group _primitive types_ together, give it a name (a new type), and refer to it later.  This is another powerful abstraction in programming languages that help us to think at a higher conceptual level without worrying about the details.   Commonly used examples are mathematical objects such as complex numbers, 2D data points, multi-dimensional vectors, circles, etc, or every day objects such as a person, a product, etc.

Defining composite data type allows programmers to abstract away (and be separated from the concern of) how a complex data type is represented.

For instance, a circle on a 2D plane can be represented by the center (`x`, `y`) and its radius `r`, or it can be represented by the top left corner (`x`,`y`) and the width `w` of the bounding square.

In C, we build composite data type with `struct`.  For example,

```C
struct circle {
  float x, y; // (x,y) coordinate of the center.
  float r; // radius
}
```

Once we have the `struct` defined, we are not completely shielded from its representation, until we write a set of functions that operates on the `circle` composite type.  For instance,

```C
float circle_area(circle c) { ... };
bool  circle_contains_point(circle c, point p) { ... };
  :
```

Implementing these functions obviously requires the knowledge of how a circle is represented.  Once the set of functions that operates on and manipulates circles is available, we can use _circle_ type without worrying about the internal representation.  

If we decide to change the representation of a circle, then only the set of functions that operates on a circle type need to be changed, but not the code that uses circles to do other things.

We can imagine an _abstraction barrier_ between the code that uses a composite data type along with its associated set of functions, and the code that define the data type along with the implementation of the functions.  Above the barrier, the concern is about using the composite data type to do useful things, while below the barrier, the concern is about how to represent and manipulate the composite data type.

While many of you are used to writing a program solo, in practice, you rarely write a program with contributions from a single person.  The abstraction barrier separates the role of the programmer into two: (i) an _implementer_, which define that data type and provide the implementation, and (ii) a _client_, which uses the composite data type to perform a higher level task[^4].  Part of my aim in CS2030 is to switch your mindset into thinking in terms of these two roles.  Note that the implementer and the client may very well be the same programmer.

[^4]: which may include providing another more complex composite data type.

## Abstraction: Class and Object (or, Encapsulation)

We can further bundle the composite data type and its associated functions together in another abstraction, called a _class_.  A class is a data type with a group of functions associated with it.  We call the functions as _methods_ and the data in the class as _fields_ (or _members_, or _states_, or _attributes_[^4]).   A well-designed class maintains the abstraction barrier, properly wraps the barrier around the internal representation and implementation, and exposes just the right _interface_ for others to use.

[^4]: Computer scientists just can't decide on what to call this!

Just like we can create variables of a given type, we can create _objects_ of a given class.  Objects are _instances_ of a class, each allowing the same methods to be called, and each containing the same set of variables of the same types, but (possibly) storing different values.

Recall that programs written in a procedural language such as a C consists of functions, with a `main()` function as the entry point.  A program written in an _object-oriented language_ such as Java consists of classes, with one main class as the entry point.  One can view a running object-oriented (or OO) program as something that instantiates objects of different classes and orchestrates their interactions with each other by calling each others' methods.

One could argue that an object-oriented way of writing programs is much more natural, as it mirrors our world more closely.  If we look around us, we see objects all around us, and each object has certain properties, exhibit certain behavior, and they allow certain actions.  We interact with the objects through their interfaces, and we rarely need to know the internals of the objects we used everyday (unless we try to repair it)[^5].  

[^5]: This is a standard analogy in an OOP textbook.  In practice, however, we often have to write programs that include abstract concepts with no tangible real-world analogy as classes.

The concept of keeping all the data and functions operating on the data related to a composite data type together within an abstraction barrier is called _encapsulation_.

## Breaking the Abstraction Barrier

In the ideal case, the code above the abstraction barrier would just call the provided interface to use the composite data type.  There, however, may be cases where a programmer may intentionally or accidentally break the abstraction barrier.  

Consider the case of implementing `circle` as a C `struct`.  Suppose someone wants to move the center of the circle `c` to a new position (`x`, `y`), instead of implementing a function `circle_move_to(c, x, y)` (which would still keep the representation used under the barrier), the person wrote:

```C
c.x = x;
c.y = y;
```

This code would still be correct, but the abstraction barrier is broken since we now make explicit assumption that there are two variables `x` and `y` inside the `circle` data type that corresponds to the center of the circle.  If one day, we want to represent a circle differently, then we have to carefully change all the code that read and write these variables `x` and `y` and update them.

!!! note "Breaking Python's Abstraction Barrier"
    Python tries to prevent _accidental_ access to internal representation by having a convention of prefixing the internal variables with `_` (one underscore) or `__` (two underscores).   This method, however, does not prevent a lazy programmer from directly accessing the variables and possibly planting a bug/error that will surface later.

## Data Hiding

Many OO languages allow programmers to explicitly specify if a field or a method can be accessed from outside the abstraction barrier.  Java, for instance, supports `private` and `public` access modifiers[^5].  A field or a method that is declared as `private` cannot be accessed from outside the class, and can only be accessed within the class.  On the other hand, as you can guess, a `public` field or method can be accessed, modified, or invoked from outside the class.

[^5]: Others include `protected` and the _default_ modifier.  For beginners, it is better that we explicitly specify something as `private` or `public`.

Such mechanism to protect the abstraction barrier from being broken is called _data hiding_ or _information hiding_.  This protection is enforced by the _compiler_ at compile time.

## Example: The Circle class

Let's put together the concepts of encapsulation and data hiding to define a `Circle` class in Java:

```Java
/**
 * A Circle object encapsulates a circle on a 2D plane.  
 */
class Circle {
  private double x;  // x-coordinate of the center
  private double y;  // y-coordinate of the center
  private double r;  // the length of the radius

  /**
   * Return the area of the circle.
   */
  public double getArea() {
    return 3.1415926 * r * r;
  }

  /**
   * Move the center of the circle to the new position (newX, newY)
   */
  public void moveTo(double newX, double newY) {
    x = newX;
    y = newY;
  }
}
```

Here, we define `x`, `y`, and `r` as three private fields inside the class `Circle`.  Note that these fields are not accessible and modifiable outside of the class `Circle`, but they can be accessed and modified within `Circle` (inside the abstraction barrier), such as in the methods `getArea` and `moveTo`.

## Constructors, Accessors, and Mutators

With data hiding, we completely isolate the internal representation of a class using an abstraction barrier.  With no way for the user of the class to modify the fields directly, it is common for a class to provide methods to initialize and modify these internal fields (such as the `moveTo()` method above).  A method that initializes an object is called a _constructor_, and a method that retrieves or modifies the properties of the object is called the _accessor_ (or _getter_) or _mutator_ (or _setter_).

A constructor method is a special method within the class.  It cannot be called directly but is invoked automatically when an object is instantiated.   In Java, a constructor method _has the same name as the class_ and _has no return type_.  A constructor can take in arguments just like other functions.  The class `Circle` can have a constructor such as the following:

```Java
class Circle {
    :
  /**
   * Create a circle centered on (centerX, centerY) with given radius
  */
  public Circle(double centerX, double centerY, double radius) {
    x = centerX;
    y = centerY;
    r = radius;
  }
    :
}
```

The use of accessor and mutator methods is a bit controversial.   Suppose that we provide an accessor method and a mutator method for every private field, then we are actually exposing the internal representation, therefore breaking the encapsulation.  For instance:

```Java
class Circle {
    :

  public double getX() {
    return x;
  }

  public void setX(double newX) {
    x = newX;
  }

  public double getY() {
    return y;
  }

  public void setY(double newY) {
    y = newY:
  }

  public double getR() {
    return r;
  }

  public void setR(double newR) {
    r = newR;
  }
    :
}
```

The examples above are pretty pointless.  If we need to know the internal and do something with it, we are doing it wrong.  The right approach is to implement a method within the class that do whatever we want the class to do.   For instance, suppose that we want to know the circumference of the circle `c`, one approach would be:

```Java
   double circumference = 2*c.getR()*3.1415926;
```

where `c` is a `Circle` object.

A better approach would be to add a new method `getCircumference()` in the `Circle` class, and call it instead:
```Java
   double circumference = c.getCircumference();
```

The better approach involves writing a few more lines of code to implement the method, but it keeps the encapsulation intact.  If one fine day, the implementer of `Circle` decided to store the diameter of the circle instead of the radius, then only the implementer needs to change the implementation of `getCircumference`.  The client does not have to change anything.  

!!! note "Constructor in Python and JavaScript"
    In Python, the constructor is the `__init__` method.   In JavaScript, the constructor is simply called `constructor`.


## Class Fields and Methods

Let's look at the implementation of `getArea()` above.  We use the constant $\pi$ but hardcoded it as 3.1415926.  Hardcoding such a magic number is a _no-no_ in terms of coding style.  This constant can appear in more than one places. If we hardcode such a number and want to change its precision later, we would need to trace down and change every occurrence.  Every time we need to use $\pi$, we have to remember or look up what is the precision that we use.  Not only does this practice introduce more work, it is also likely to introduce bugs.  

In C, we define $\pi$ as a macro constant `M_PI`.  But how should we do this in Java?  This is where the ideal that a program consists of only objects with internal states that communicate with each other feel a bit constraining.  The constant $\pi$ is universal, and does not really belong to any object (the value of $\pi$ is the same for every circle!).  Another example: if we define a method `sqrt()` that computes the square root of a given number, this is a general function that is not associated with any object as well.

A solution to this is to associate these _global_ values and functions with a _class_ instead of with an _object_.  For instance. Java predefines a [`Math`](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/Math.html) class[^7] that is populated with constants `PI` and `E` (for Euler's number $e$), along with a long list of mathematical functions.  To associate a method or a field with a class in Java, we declare them with the `static` keyword.  We can additionally add a keyword `final` to indicate that the value of the field will not change[^8].

[^7]: The class `Math` is provided by the package `java.lang` in Java.  A package is simply a set of related classes (and interfaces, but I have not told you what is an interface yet).  To use this class, we need to add the line `import java.lang.Math` at the beginning of our program.

[^8]: A `final` method refers to a method that cannot be _overridden_.  Do not worry for now if you don't understand what overriding a method means.

```Java
class Math {
  :
  public static final double PI = 3.141592653589793;
  :
  :
}
```

We call these fields and methods that are associated with a class as _class fields_ and _class methods_, and fields and methods that are associated with an object as _instance fields_ and _instance methods_.

!!! note "Class Fields and Methods in Python"
    Note that, in Python, any variable declared within a `class` block is a class field:
    ```Python
    class Circle:
      x = 0
      y = 0
    ```
    In the above example, `x` and `y` are class fields, not instance fields.

## Example: The Circle class

Now, let revise our `Circle` class to improve the code and make it a little more complete:

```Java
import java.lang.Math;

/**
 * A Circle object encapsulates a circle on a 2D plane.  
 */
class Circle {
  private double x;  // x-coordinate of the center
  private double y;  // y-coordinate of the center
  private double r;  // the length of the radius

  /**
   * Create a circle centered on (centerX, centerY) with given radius
  */
  public Circle(double centerX, double centerY, double radius) {
    x = centerX;
    y = centerY;
    r = radius;
  }

  /**
   * Return the area of the circle.
   */
  public double getArea() {
    return Math.PI*r*r;
  }

  /**
   * Return the circumference of the circle.
   */
  public double getCircumference() {
    return Math.PI*2*r;
  }

  /**
   * Move the center of the circle to the new position (newX, newY)
   */
  public void moveTo(double newX, double newY) {
    x = newX;
    y = newY;
  }

  /**
   * Return true if the given point (testX, testY) is within the circle.
   */
  public boolean contains(double testX, double testY) {
    return false;
    // TODO: left as an exercise  
  }
}
```

## Creating and Interacting with `Circle` objects

To use the `Circle` class, we can either:

* create a `main()` function, compile and link with the `Circle` class, and create an executable program, just like we usually do with a C program, OR
* use `jshell`, which is part of Java 9 (but not earlier versions). `jshell` provides a _read-evaluate-print loop_ (REPL) to help us quickly try out various features of Java.

We will write a complete Java program with `main()` later in this class, but for now, we will use `jshell` to demonstrate the various language features of Java[^8].

[^8]: You can download and install `jshell` yourself, as part of [Java Development Kit version 9 (JDK 9)](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk9-downloads-3848520.html)

The demonstration below loads the `Circle` class written above (with the `contains` method completed) from a file named `Circle.java`[^9], and creates two `Circle` objects, `c1` and `c2`.  We use the `new` keyword to tell Java to create an object of type `Circle` here, passing in the center and the radius.

```Java
Circle c1 = new Circle(0, 0, 100);
```

[^9]: We use the convention of one public class per file, name the file with the exact name of the class (including capitalization), and include the extension `.java` to the filename.

<script type="text/javascript" src="https://asciinema.org/a/132906.js" id="asciicast-132906" async></script>

## Reference Type vs. Primitive Type

The variable `c1` actually stores an abstraction over a _reference_ to the Circle object, instead of the object itself.
_All objects are stored as references in Java_.

The other variable type supported in Java is _primitive_ type.  A variable of primitive type stores the _value_ instead of a reference to the value.
Java supports eight _primitive_ data types: `byte`, `short`, `int`, `long`, `float`, `double`, `boolean` and `char`.  If you are familiar with C, these data types should not be foreign to you.  One important difference is that a `char` variable stores a 16-bit Unicode character, not an 8-bit character like in C.  Java uses the type `byte` for that.  The other notable difference is that Java defines `true` and `false` as possible value to a `boolean`, unlike C which uses `0` for false and non-`0` for true.  

You can read all about Java [variables](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/nutsandbolts/variables.html) and [primitive data types](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/nutsandbolts/datatypes.html) in Oracle's Java Tutorial.

## Type Safety

Some languages are stricter in terms of type "compatibility" than others.  C compilers, however, are not very strict.  If it detects something strange with the type you used, it will issue a warning, but still let your code compiles and runs.

Take:

```C
#include <stdio.h>
int main()
{
	printf("%d\n", "cs2030");
}
```

In Line 4, we treat the address to a string as integer.  This generates a compiler's warning.

In C, you can _type cast_ a variable from one type into another, i.e., force the compiler to treat a variable of one type as another type.  The compiler would listen and do that for you.  The following code would print out gibberish and would compile perfectly without error.

```C
#include <stdio.h>
int main()
{
	printf("%d\n", (int)"cs2030");
}
```

Such flexibility and loose rules for type compatibility could be useful, if you know what you are doing, but for most programmers, it could be a major source of unintentional bugs, especially if one does not pay attention to compiler's warning or one forces the warning to go away without fully understanding what is going on.

Java is very strict when it comes to type checking, and is one of the _type-safe_ languages. Java ensures that basic operations (such as `+`, `-`, etc) and method calls apply to values in a way that makes sense.  If you try to pull the same trick as above, you will receive an error:

<script type="text/javascript" src="https://asciinema.org/a/133995.js" id="asciicast-133995" async></script>

## Exercise

1.  In the example above, we implemented a class `Circle`.  There, we store and pass around two `double` variables that correspond to the x-coordinate and y-coordinate of a point.  The code would be neater if we create a second class `Point` that encapsulates the concept of a point on a 2D plane and the operations on points.

    Implement a new class `Point` and modify the class `Circle` to use the class `Point`.  Pay attention to what methods and fields (if any) you expose as `public` outside of the abstraction barrier of a `Point` object.

    You will need to use `jshell` from Java 1.9 (or JDK 9) to interact with your new classes.

2.  Use `jshell` to try out the following.

    ```Java
    class A {
	    public static int x = 1;
	    public int y = 5;

	    void incrX() {
		    x = x + 1;
	    }

	    void incrY() {
		    y = y + 1;
	    }
    }

    A a1 = new A();
    A a2 = new A();
    ```

    After executing `a1.x = 10`, what is the value of `a2.x`?

    After executing `a1.y = 10`, what is the value of `a2.y`?

    Is `A.x = 3` a valid statement?  Is `A.y = 3` a valid statement?  

    Note: Even though `a1.x` is valid, it is considered a bad programming practice to access a class field through an instance variable (e.g., `a1.x`).  The proper way to do it is to use the class name `A.x`).

3.  Consider the following two classes:

    ```Java
    class A {
    	private int x;
        public void changeSelf() {
            x = 1;
        }
        public void changeAnother(A a) {
            a.x = 1;
        }

    }

    class B {
    	public void changeAnother(A a) {
    		a.x = 1;
    	}
    }
    ```

    Which line(s) above violate the `private` access modifier of `x`?
